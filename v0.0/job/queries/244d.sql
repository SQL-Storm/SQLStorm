One day, the elves are leaving the enchanted forest to enter the world of the human beings. They encounter hitherto unknown challenges: having to look for work, having to decide how to live, reading timetables and finding the love of their life. Suddenly, their days are full of difficult situations. The magical powers will not help them - or will they? Leaving the Magic Forest was developed and shot with the close collaboration of pupils of the Paul-Kraemer-School in Frechen, near Cologne. They are telling their own personal stories about leaving school and entering the world of the grown-ups. The film shows their dreams, their fears, their wishes and their reality.'
