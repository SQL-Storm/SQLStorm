The friction generated by high speeds heats up the skin, making it expand significantly. Expansion gaps are needed to prevent the skin from buckling or breaking due to the stress, like the tar strips in concrete roadways that allow the slabs to expand without damage. Therefore, after several supersonic sprints to heat the skin enough to fill the gaps, the plane takes off on nearly empty tanks, and refuels five minutes into flight. Otherwise, it will run out of fuel.';
