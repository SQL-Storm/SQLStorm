How, in general, does this relate to the larger African-American community in the city, now dispersed throughout, and the decidedly multicultural Las Vegas of the 21st Century? Through interviews with local residents, police, educators, activists, and clergy, Invisible Las Vegas Part II tells the heretofore untold story of modern, post-segregation West Las Vegas. With stunning cinematography, original historical research and heartfelt testimony, this latest documentary from Desert Rose Productions brings the tragedy and triumph, the struggle and love that drives this American community to life.', 'When Baron Frederick de Berghman learns that his wife has given birth to twin boys, he refuses to drink a toast to them. He tells his courtiers that there is a prophecy that the younger of the twins - in this case born one minute after the elder - will kill his older brother in the Black Room. As a protective measure, he seals off the room in the hope that the prophecy may not happen. Many years later, Baron Gregor de Berghman pleads with his twin brother Anton to return to the family castle. Anton arrives to find the populace in revolt and there is even an attempt on his life when they mistake him for the Baron. There is no doubt that the Baron is evil and eventually kills Anton in the Black Room and takes his identity. That does no mean the prophecy cannot, or will not, come true.') AND mc.id > 1664886;
