AND mi.info < 'CONT: The alien vehicle approaches the Montana on a course that nearly leads to a head-on collision. It is moving at 130 knots and the sub is moving toward it, yet it takes about 13 seconds for the range to close from 200 to 100 yards and another 3-4 seconds to come down to 60 yards, corresponding to a combined speed in the range of 13 to 20 knots. An object moving at 130 knots will go about 950 yards in 13 seconds, nearly half a mile (2025.37 yards in 1 nautical mile - 1 nautical mile = 1.15 statute miles or 1.852 kilometers)';
