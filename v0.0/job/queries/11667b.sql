AND mi.info > 'Masamichi Kanari evacuated to Tokyo on March 15th, 2011. It was the day, when the radioactive materials arrived in Tokyo. He owned a cram school in Fukushima. He had run away from the danger, leaving his students. Kanari takes a journey, coming back. When the typhoon hit Tokyo, he sees his homeland with hideous scar after the great earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear accident. And the people living in Fukushima were divided into two. People who left and people who stayed after the unclear accident. This film has two important elements. They are cites,Tokyo and Fukushima. There we could see many things through Kanari. That is life-and-death,the past, present,and future. What is human? Now is the time for us to think about it.'
