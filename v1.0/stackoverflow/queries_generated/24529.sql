### Explanation of Query Constructs:

1. **CTEs**: 
   - `RankedPosts` gathers post details, ranks them by creation date per post type, and aggregates comments, votes, and tags. It also handles NULL values.
   - `PostHistoryDetails` retrieves the most recent edit actions involving titles and closure events.

2. **Window Function**: 
   - The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used for ranking the posts per type.

3. **LEFT JOIN**: 
   - Combines data from posts, comments, votes, and tags ensuring all posts are included, even if there are no related comments, votes, or tags.

4. **Aggregate Functions**: 
   - `COUNT()` for comment counts, `SUM()` for total bounties from votes, and `STRING_AGG()` to create a comma-separated list of tags.

5. **COALESCE**: 
   - Used to handle potential NULL values, providing defaults like 'Unknown' or 'N/A'.

6. **Complicated Predicate Logic**: 
   - Filters posts created within the last 5 years, having a positive score, ensuring the owner exists.

7. **Unusual Semantics**: 
   - The handling of `NULL` scores by ordering them at the end, while also incorporating both `DESC` and `ASC` ordering intelligently.

This query would perform benchmarks on how many posts exist, leading to trends based on user engagement in terms of comments, votes, and edits over time across various post types.
