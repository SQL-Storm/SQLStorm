This SQL query does the following:
1. It creates a CTE `RankedPosts` to gather posts, their owners, comments, and votes while ranking them based on score and creation date.
2. It filters the posts with the `FilteredPosts` CTE based on a requirement of having at least 5 comments and more upvotes than downvotes.
3. It calculates tag counts with `TagCounts`, creating an aggregate count for each tag present in the posts.
4. The final selection from `FilteredPosts` joins with `HighestTags` to get the most frequently used tag in the filtered results.
5. It generates a final result set that includes information about active/archived status based on the creation date of the posts, while maintaining various complicated predicates and expressing various SQL constructs like CTEs, outer joins, and window functions.
