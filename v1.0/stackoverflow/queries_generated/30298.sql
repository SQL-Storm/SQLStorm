### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **Recursive CTE**: `RecursivePostHierarchy` is defined to create a hierarchy of posts, starting from questions and including their answers, enabling tracking of conversations.

2. **Main SELECT Statement**: 
    - The main query aggregates information about users, counting their posts, distinguishing between questions and answers, and calculating average vote scores.
    - It retrieves associated tags using a join with the `Tags` table and ensuring that the tag names are present in the post's tags using string matching.
    - The last edit time of posts is also included.

3. **Joining with Other Tables**: The query joins multiple tables:
   - `Votes` to calculate the vote scores,
   - `PostLinks` to potentially count linked posts,
   - `Badges` to count achievements of users.

4. **Filtering Criteria**: 
    - Users with a reputation greater than 1000 are selected.
    - A `HAVING` clause ensures that only active users with more than 5 posts and an average positive vote score are included.
  
5. **Ranking and Limiting**: 
    - The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function ranks users based on their total posts, and the result is limited to the top 10 users.

This complex query showcases a variety of SQL constructs, including common table expressions, joins, window functions, and aggregation, allowing for detailed performance benchmarking and analysis of user engagement in the Stack Overflow schema.
