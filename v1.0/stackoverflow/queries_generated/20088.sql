This SQL query incorporates several SQL constructs and features:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Multiple CTEs are used to organize the logic, including ranking posts, aggregating statistics, and tracking closed posts.
2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER` function is used to rank posts based on their score and creation date.
3. **Aggregates and Conditional Logic**: The query counts votes and comments and applies conditional aggregation to get upvotes and downvotes.
4. **Outer Joins**: Used to get closure counts for posts while still including those that havenâ€™t been closed.
5. **Complex Predicates**: Filters to include only those posts that have a specific view count and were active in the past year.
6. **String Expressions and Calculations**: Categorizes posts based on their score, illustrating a mix of performance measurement and post engagement.
7. **NULL Logic**: Utilizes `COALESCE` to handle potential nulls from outer joins appropriately.
8. **Obscure Semantics**: The use of `NULLS LAST` in the `ORDER BY` clause provides a niche flexibility in sorting.

This query could be used as a benchmark for evaluating performance in handling complex SQL constructs and the calculations they entail.
