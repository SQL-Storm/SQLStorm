This query performs the following tasks:

1. **Recursive CTE**: It creates a recursive Common Table Expression (`RecursivePostCTE`) to gather parent-child relationships for questions and their answers.

2. **Aggregating User Data**: It joins the `Users`, `Posts`, `Badges`, and `Votes` tables to summarize usersâ€™ contributions based on their questions and answers while filtering users with a reputation over 100.

3. **Calculating Metrics**:
   - Counts total questions and answers.
   - Sums the scores of all their answers.
   - Retrieves the highest class of any badge they possess.
   - Counts total votes they received for their answers.

4. **Tag Aggregation**: It utilizes string functions to gather all tags associated with the user's posts.

5. **Average Days to Response**: It calculates the average time taken to get a response in days for all the answers associated with the questions.

6. **Final Output**: Orders the results by total score descending and by user name ascending.
