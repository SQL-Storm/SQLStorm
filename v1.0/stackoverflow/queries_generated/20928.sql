### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Several CTEs are created to filter, aggregate, and rank posts based on different criteria.
   - **RankedPosts**: Filters for questions from the last year, ranking them by creation date for each user.
   - **UserVotes**: Counts upvotes and downvotes per user.
   - **PostHistoryInfo**: Aggregates changes made to posts in the last 30 days, summarizing types of changes.
   - **TopUsers**: Combines user information with their voting statistics and changes made to posts.

2. **Final Selection**: Selects top users based on their reputations, ensuring the final output reflects users with a satisfactory ratio of upvotes to downvotes, having more than 10 questions and ordered by the number of post changes they initiated.

3. **String Aggregation**: Utilizes `STRING_AGG` to create a comma-separated list of tags across the user's filtered questions.

This query is structured to engage with intricate outer joins, grouping, and aggregation while presenting data in a usable format, making it ideal for performance benchmarking.
