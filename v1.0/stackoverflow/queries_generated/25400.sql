- Aggregate details about the types of posts they've made.
- Average reputation of the users.
- Average score of their posts.
- Earliest and latest dates of their posts. 

The results are grouped by user, and ordered by the total number of posts and the average score of those posts, allowing for meaningful benchmarking of string processing and user interaction in the Stack Overflow environment.
