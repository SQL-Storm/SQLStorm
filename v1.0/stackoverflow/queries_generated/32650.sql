In this SQL query:

- A recursive CTE (`RecursivePostHierarchy`) is defined to capture questions and their corresponding answers.
- A separate CTE (`UserScore`) is created to calculate the total upvotes and downvotes for each user, along with their badge counts.
- Another CTE (`RankedUsers`) ranks the users based on their upvote and badge counts.
- The final query selects data from the recursive hierarchy and joins it with ranked user information while counting the comments per answer.
- The results are filtered to only include valid answers and ordered by the question creation date and user rank, limited to the top 100 entries.
