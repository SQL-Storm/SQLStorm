This query benchmarks string processing by aggregating data related to posts, specifically focusing on questions. It ranks the top 10 questions based on answer counts and upvotes while collecting relevant information such as the post title and owner's display name. Using the Common Table Expressions (CTEs) improves readability and modularizes the logic for better performance insights.
