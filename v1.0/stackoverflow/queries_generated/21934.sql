This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. **CTEs**:
   - **RankedPosts**: Identifies recent posts per user within the last year and ranks them.
   - **UserStatistics**: Aggregates user statistics such as total posts, accepted answers, and total bounties.
   - **PostHistoryDetails**: Calculates editing activity details per post.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Joins the aggregated data to gather comprehensive statistics about users' activity on the platform while excluding those with no posts.
   - Calculates average view counts per user and aggregates associated tags from posts.
   - Applies pagination starting from the 10th result and fetches the next 10 results.

3. **Logic**: 
   - Ensures diverse conditions like handling NULL logic with `COALESCE` and tag association through string matching.

4. **Complexity**: 
   - Incorporates various SQL features like window functions, correlated queries, CTEs, string aggregation, and complicated grouping and ordering logic, making it suitable for performance benchmarking.
