This elaborate SQL query aims at performance benchmarking and works on a provided StackOverflow-like schema. It incorporates various advanced constructs, including CTEs, window functions, and complex predicates, to analyze user interactions with posts, including comment counts, voting behavior, and closed reasons, while also applying relevant business logic and filtering criteria.
