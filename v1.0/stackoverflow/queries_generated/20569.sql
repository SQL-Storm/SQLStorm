This SQL query comprises several interesting constructs:

1. The use of CTEs (`Common Table Expressions`) to structure the query.
2. `LEFT JOIN` to attach related data from `PostHistory` and `Users`.
3. `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank posts by their creation date for each user.
4. Aggregate calculations for counting comments and evaluating vote balances.
5. Usage of `HAVING` clause to filter top contributors based on a score threshold.
6. A correlated subquery to ensure that no users voted to delete a post, while wrapping columns to handle possible `NULL` values.

These forms of constructs enhance the query's capability to perform benchmarking based on various performance metrics while also showcasing the power of SQL in querying relational databases.
