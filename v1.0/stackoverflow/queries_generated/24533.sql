This SQL query performs an elaborate operation by:

- Using common table expressions (CTEs) to rank posts and filter recent post history.
- Incorporating window functions to generate ranks and counts of votes.
- Selecting data from both the `Posts` and `PostHistory` tables with various conditions based on post types, score, and views.
- Using `COALESCE` and string concatenation to format output strings.
- Including complex predicates to filter on post types and conditions for retrieval of posts.
- Employing an `OFFSET` to paginate the results, returning the middle section of the ranked results.

This query would serve well for performance benchmarking, demonstrating SQL's ability to handle complex logic, multiple joins, and aggregation functions in a cohesive manner.
