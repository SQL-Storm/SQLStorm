This SQL query generates a comprehensive benchmark by first selecting and ranking posts based on various metrics. It categorizes posts into 'Popular', 'Controversial', or 'Neutral', and also checks for the last closure and reopening dates of the posts. Additionally, it collects user stats for those who have earned the most badges among users interacting with the posts in question. The complexities include various window functions, CTEs, and the consideration of intricate logical conditions for the ranking and grouping.
