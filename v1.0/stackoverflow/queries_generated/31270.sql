This query performs several complex operations:

1. **CTEs**: The `RankedPosts` CTE ranks posts based on view counts per user, displaying both the number of comments per post and total bounties per post. The `UserStats` CTE aggregates badge counts for users.

2. **Outer Join**: It considers comments and votes, ensuring users can see all posts even if they have no comments and votes.

3. **Window Functions**: Utilizes ROW_NUMBER() to rank posts and COUNT() to calculate comments and totals seamlessly within partitions.

4. **Recursive CTE**: A second part of the query demonstrates a recursive CTE that builds a hierarchy of posts, which helps illustrate parent-child relationships among posts.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The query employs WHERE clauses and JOIN logic to filter and connect users and their most significant posts and combines these results meaningfully. 

6. **Final Selection and Ordering**: It organizes the final results by reputation and view count, showcasing not only the posts but the user behind them and their accomplishments.
