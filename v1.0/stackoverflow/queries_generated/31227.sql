### Explanation

1. **Recursive CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) retrieves all questions and their answers in a recursive manner to build an understanding of how answers are related to their parent questions.

2. **Aggregation and Joins**: User details are retrieved by joining them with their questions (Posts) while calculating:
   - The count of questions per user,
   - Total votes (up and down),
   - Average score of the user's questions,
   - Tags associated with each question aggregated into a string.

3. **Filtering**: The WHERE clause ensures that we're only considering users with a reputation above 100, aligning with a quality metric. The HAVING clause filters for users who have posted more than five questions.

4. **Sorting and Limits**: The result set is sorted by the total vote count (descending) to highlight the most influential users, and the result is limited to the top 10.

5. **NULL Logic**: The COALESCE function is used to handle potential NULL values effectively, particularly for votes and scores.

6. **String Expressions and Set Operators**: Uses string aggregation to concatenate tags associated with each question.

This query showcases advanced SQL capabilities, suitable for performance benchmarking in various database systems.
