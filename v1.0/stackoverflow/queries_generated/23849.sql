-- Including potential corner cases by applying some constraints with NOT NULL handling and NULL logic

This SQL query features complex constructs such as CTEs for user engagement and post statistics, various outer joins to include users with low activity, window functions for ranking posts, and incorporates NULL handling to ensure meaningful output despite potential missing values. It also integrates aggregate functions and advanced filtering to produce a comprehensive user activity overview, making it suitable for performance benchmarking in a nuanced way.
