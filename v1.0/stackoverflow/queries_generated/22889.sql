This query performs a set of interesting actions: it ranks posts based on view counts, calculates total bounties for posts, counts edit history from the `PostHistory` table, and generates some derived information such as comment status and tag aggregations through somewhat unorthodox string operations. It incorporates CTEs, window functions, lateral joins, and employs various aggregate functions to create a comprehensive view of top posts while navigating through complex SQL semantics.
