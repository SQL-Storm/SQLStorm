This query is constructed with the following key components:

1. **Recursive CTE** (`UserHierarchy`): It retrieves users with a reputation greater than 500 and attempts to build a hierarchy path based on an arbitrary correlation (for illustrative purposes).

2. **Post Statistics CTE** (`PostStats`): Aggregates statistics on posts including comment counts and various vote types (upvotes, downvotes, close votes).

3. **Ranked Posts CTE** (`RankedPosts`): Ranks posts for each user based on their upvote counts, partitioned by the user.

4. **Active Users CTE** (`ActiveUsers`): Filters those users who have more than a specified number of upvotes, identifying them as active.

5. **Final Selection**: Joins the hierarchical user data with the active user statistics, applying filters on the reputation and allowing for a descending order based on user reputation and hierarchy path.

Each CTE and expression in the SQL query contributes to a complex benchmarking criteria involving users, posts, votes, and their relationships.
