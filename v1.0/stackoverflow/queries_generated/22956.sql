This SQL query performs an elaborate performance benchmark by:

1. Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize user vote statistics and post statistics separately.
2. Implementing outer joins to gather counts of votes and comments linked to users and posts.
3. Employing window functions to rank posts based on total bounty and most recent activity.
4. Including set operators through filtering based on calculated averages and ranking metrics from the `PostStats` table.
5. Filtering out users with less than or equal to 5 total votes and selecting top-ranking posts based on various criteria.
6. Returning a limited result set for performance benchmarking. 

This combines complex aggregates, counts, and ranking with logical filtering designed to explore user engagement and post performance.
