This query benchmarks string processing by aggregating statistics related to tag usage in posts. It counts posts associated with each tag, sums the bounties related to those posts, counts votes, and collects the display names of users who voted, providing a comprehensive view of the tag's activity within the forum. The output returns the top 10 tags based on the number of posts and total bounties.
