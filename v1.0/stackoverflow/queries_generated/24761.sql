This SQL query is complex and involves:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Multiple CTEs (RankedPosts, UserBadges, CloseReasonCounts, MergedStats) gather and aggregate data while making the query readable.
2. **Window Functions**: Used to rank posts by score over a window of users and count votes.
3. **Outer Join**: LEFT JOINs are used to ensure that we gather all posts and users, even if they don't have associated votes or badges.
4. **Complicated Conditions**: CASE statements are used for categorizing users based on their activity.
5. **Set Operators and Null Logic**: Aggregates user data while handling potential NULLs intelligently.
6. **Bizarre Semantics**: The query includes averaging with a subquery derived from itself.

Overall, the query intelligently combines data from multiple relations in the aforementioned schema and performs multiple aggregations while still ensuring performance due to the structured approach using CTEs.
