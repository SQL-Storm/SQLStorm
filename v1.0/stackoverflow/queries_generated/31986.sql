This query aims to extract a list of posts that meet specific criteria related to user interaction and content quality. The posts that will be included exhibit the highest scores and have substantial comments, while being authored by users with reputations over 1000. 

- We first rank the posts by their creation date for each user using a Common Table Expression (CTE).
- We aggregate the comments and votes, counting upvotes, downvotes, and deletions.
- In the final selection, we output relevant post details while accounting for NULL logic in tags, ensuring there's a sensible fallback. 
- The final results are ordered primarily by score and secondarily by view count.
