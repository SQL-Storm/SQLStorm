### Explanation of Constructs:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Three CTEs are used to first gather necessary data about tags (`RecursiveTagCTE`), summarize user statistics (`UserStats`), and to collect post activity information (`PostActivity`).

2. **Recursive Queries**: The `RecursiveTagCTE` demonstrates a recursive structure to get tags related to posts based on their relationships.

3. **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, and COALESCE are used to gather data efficiently while handling NULLs in votes and badges.

4. **Complex Predicates and Conditions**: The query evaluates posts based on several conditions, considering both the post type and the timeframe of activity.

5. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a rank based on recent activities, allowing for filtering of only the most recently active posts.

6. **JSON Aggregation**: Uses `json_agg` to build a list of tags, showcasing how to combine results into a single JSON object.

7. **Subqueries**: The `SELECT MAX(TotalVotes) FROM UserStats` subquery finds users with the maximum votes, allowing for connection to the main results.

8. **Final Selection with Ordering and LIMIT**: The final selection combines the data from various CTEs and ensures output is both interesting and limited to a manageable dataset size. 

This query exemplifies advanced SQL concepts and is structurally complex, making it suitable for performance benchmarking.
