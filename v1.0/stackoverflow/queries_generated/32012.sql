This SQL query does the following:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Builds a hierarchy of questions and their associated answers to allow exploring parent-child relationships.
2. **User Activity CTE**: Aggregates data for each user on their total posts, comments, votes, and bounties.
3. **Post Metrics CTE**: Gathers metrics about posts, including comment counts and upvote/downvote counts.
4. **Top Posts CTE**: Ranks the posts based on the number of comments and upvotes.
5. **Final Select**: Combines user activity with the top posts, filtering to show only users with active contributions, displaying a comprehensive view of user engagement in relation to popular posts. 

This complex query employs various SQL concepts, including window functions, recursive CTEs, joins, and aggregate functions, simulating a performance benchmark for user engagement and post activity within the Stack Overflow schema.
