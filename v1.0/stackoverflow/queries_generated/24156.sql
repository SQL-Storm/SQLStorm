This query performs the following complex operations:
1. It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate user activities, post statistics, and ranks for posts.
2. It includes JOINs and LEFT JOINs to aggregate data across multiple tables.
3. It applies window functions (like `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK`) to manage and compute rankings of users and posts.
4. It filters results with multiple predicates, ensuring that only users with more than average total bounty and top-ranked posts are included.
5. It incorporates correlated subqueries to access specific data related to closures in post history.
6. It incorporates conditional logic using `COALESCE` to handle NULL values in sum calculations. 

This intricate SQL structure can be used for performance benchmarking by measuring execution complexity and time across large datasets.
