This SQL query incorporates multiple advanced constructs as follows:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by their score within each post type from the last year.
   - `AnswerCountCTE`: Counts answers for each question.
   - `QuestionTitles`: Handles potential NULL or empty titles.
   - `TagStatistics`: Aggregates statistics for tags associated with posts.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking posts by score.

3. **Outer Joins**:
   - Uses `LEFT JOIN` to relate questions with their answers and tags while allowing NULLs.

4. **Complicated Predicates**:
   - Filters based on conditions like post type, creation date range, and score NULL handling.

5. **String Expressions**:
   - The `LIKE` operator in `TagStatistics` to match tags.

6. **CASE Statements**:
   - To derive status based on the presence of accepted answers and rankings.

7. **NULL Logic**:
   - Utilizes `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` to handle potential NULL values in titles and other selected fields.

8. **Obscure Semantics**: 
   - The use of `pg_catalog` functions like `NOW()` and interval arithmetic to filter recent activity, along with conditions and expressions to meaningfully display results based on aggregations and rankings.

This richly detailed query will allow for varied performance benchmarking across multiple databases that incorporate complex logic and diverse SQL functionalities.
