### Explanation of the Query Components:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `UserActivity`: Aggregates user statistics including total posts, comments, bounties, and views, alongside a rank based on total posts.
   - `ClosedPostHistory`: Filters the history of posts that have been closed or reopened, capturing the editors and post types.
   - `ClosedPostActivity`: Determines the status of each post as closed or reopened based on the edit rank.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: Combines user data with their post statuses, ensuring users with no posts still show up in the results.

3. **WINDOW FUNCTIONS**: Utilize `RANK` and `ROW_NUMBER` to manage and categorize the data effectively.

4. **NULL Logic and COALESCE**: Handles potential NULLs in user statistics and post statuses, providing defaults for clarity.

5. **COMPLICATED PREDICATES**: The WHERE clause employs sophisticated filtering ensuring that only users with a substantial activity are returned, enhancing the focus on substantial contributors. 

6. **Bizarre Semantics**: The logic in ClosedPostActivity illustrates less typical SQL use of CASE to differentiate between multiple states of changes for a single post.

This query serves as a performance benchmark by showcasing the complexity of using aggregates, joins, window functions, and the treatment of NULL values, giving insight into user engagement on posts in relation to their editing history.
