This intricate SQL query utilizes multiple CTEs to filter out recent posts, compute user rankings based on reputation, summarize recent post history comments, and gather badge details for users. It incorporates outer joins, window functions for ranking, and careful predicate constructions to meet the specified conditions, while providing a rich dataset to analyze user and post performance on the platform. The query presumes that the user ID correlates with posts via their ownership or association, which is a possible interpretation derived from the schema definition provided.
