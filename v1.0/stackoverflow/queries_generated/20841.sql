### Explanation of Query Features:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses multiple CTEs to encapsulate logic:
   - `RankedPosts`: Selects posts and ranks them per user, counting comments on posts created in the last year.
   - `TopUsers`: Filters users based on creation date and reputation.

2. **Window Functions**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` are used to obtain post ranks within users and rank users based on their reputations.

3. **LEFT JOIN**: Ensures that even users without posts are selected and have a corresponding 'No Posts' title.

4. **COALESCE and NULL Logic**: The query gracefully handles NULLs for users without posts and those with unknown locations.

5. **Correlated Subqueries**: Used to calculate recent vote counts and aggregate user tags for their posts.

6. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` is employed to concatenate distinct tag names associated with the user's posts into a single string.

This query provides a comprehensive evaluation of top users based on posts while also reflecting their activity and engagement through votes and tags, making it suitable for performance benchmarking and analysis.
