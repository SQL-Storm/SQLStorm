### Explanation:
1. **CTEs**: Two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are usedâ€”`RecentQuestions` gathers recent questions with their owners, counts, and average bounties; `ClosedQuestions` collects details of closed questions, including the last closed date and reasons.
  
2. **Joins**: The main query utilizes LEFT JOIN to relate recent questions to their closed question details, allowing for open and closed questions to be displayed.

3. **Aggregations**: Aggregation functions like `COUNT()` and `AVG()` are used, and `ARRAY_AGG()` to collect close reasons into an array.

4. **CASE Statements**: Used to determine the status of questions (Open/Closed) and to format close reason details dynamically.

5. **Filtering**: The filtering conditions ensure that only questions from the last 30 days are considered, addressing temporal data constraints.

6. **Ordering and Limiting**: The output is ordered by the answer count (descending) and latest creation date, providing a logical view of trending questions.

7. **NULL Handling**: NULLs are handled explicitly, with `COALESCE()` providing default values where necessary. 

This query showcases a blend of various SQL functionalities and complexities that are useful for performance benchmarking.
