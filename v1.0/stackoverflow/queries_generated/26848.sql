This query benchmarks string processing by identifying the top 10 highest-scoring questions, along with relevant information about their authors, including their display names, reputation, and badge counts. It utilizes CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to first gather relevant data about posts, then filter for the top posts based on score, and finally, retrieves associated user data to analyze relationships based on author metrics.
