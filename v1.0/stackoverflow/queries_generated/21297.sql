### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `RankedPosts` CTE computes scores for posts based on upvotes and downvotes. It assigns a rank to each post per user, ordering by score. This helps in spotlighting users with high-scoring posts.

2. **Aggregates and Nested Queries**: Utilizing `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `STRING_AGG` shows usersâ€™ contributions and highlights their best posts, creating a summary of their activity over the past year.

3. **Conditional Logic**: The CASE statement categorizes badges into Gold, Silver, and Bronze with contextual labels.

4. **NULL Handling**: The use of `COALESCE` ensures that if there are no votes for a post, it contributes zero to the score.

5. **Join Mechanics**: Outer joins are applied to relate users to their posts and their badges, handling cases where users have zero posts or badges gracefully.

6. **Filters on Grouping**: The `HAVING` clause restricts results to users with a minimum level of activity and elite posts, eliminating less active users.

7. **Pagination**: The query fetches a specific number of result rows, supporting scenarios with potentially large datasets.

8. **String Manipulation**: In the aggregation of titles, it concatenates titles of the top posts efficiently into a single string with delimiters.

9. **Potentially Bizarre Semantics**: Intricate use of window functions and string aggregation in conjunction with conditional logic can lead to less common SQL practices that still deliver meaningful insights.
