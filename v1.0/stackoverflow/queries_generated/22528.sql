This query performs several interesting operations:
- It calculates the top 10 ranked posts from the last month using window functions and joins to collect relevant comment counts.
- It aggregates vote counts separately, handling upvotes and downvotes using conditional aggregation.
- A `WITH` clause selects relevant post history, including details on closures or deletions.
- It combines all this information into a final report that includes metadata about the postâ€™s status and any closure comments from the history.
