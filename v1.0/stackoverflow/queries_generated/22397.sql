This SQL query accomplishes the following:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by view count within their post type, filtering to one year.
   - `UserBadges`: Counts badges per user to assess contribution levels.
   - `PostComments`: Counts comments per post for engagement metrics.
   - `ClosedPosts`: Identifies the closure date of posts.
   - `PostMetrics`: Assembles information from the previous CTEs while handling potential NULL values gracefully.

2. **Window Functions**: Used to rank posts and count badges.

3. **Complicated Predicates**: Includes filtering for posts with accepted answers and incorporates logic to determine post statuses and contributor statuses based on a badge count.

4. **Outer Joins**: Allows for potential NULLs without excluding posts or users, essential for comprehensive analytics.

5. **String Expressions & NULL Logic**: Handles potential NULL values to provide meaningful outputs like 'Open' or 'Closed'.

This query generates a detailed analytic view of posts, their authors based on badge counts, and community engagement through comments while providing a robust framework for performance benchmarking with intricate SQL features.
