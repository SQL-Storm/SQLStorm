### Explanation:
1. **CTEs Used:**
   - `RankedPosts`: Assigns a rank to posts based on their score and view count using a window function.
   - `RecentClosedPosts`: Gathers the most recent close dates for posts from the `PostHistory` table, focusing on posts that are closed.
   - `PostDetails`: Joins the `RankedPosts` and `RecentClosedPosts` to compile all post details, including their engagement metrics.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Selects various details, categorizes post status as "Active" or "Closed," and evaluates engagement levels based on complex predicates using sums and logical conditions.

3. **Outer Joins & COALESCE Usage:**
   - Outer joins are utilized to gather upvote and downvote counts even for posts with no votes, demonstrating handling of NULLs effectively.

4. **Correlated Subqueries & Window Functions:**
   - These are used for ranking posts within the `RankedPosts` CTE, and aggregate functions for calculating vote counts.

5. **Complicated Predicate Logic:**
   - A rather unusual way of categorizing engagement levels that reflects complex SQL logic is introduced, showcasing advanced SQL capabilities.

### Note:
The SQL statement is designed to perform complex operations and may require optimization based on the SQL engine and size of the datasets involved.
