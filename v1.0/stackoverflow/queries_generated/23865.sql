This SQL query pulls a comprehensive analysis of posts created in the last year, incorporating a range of constructs including CTEs for organized subqueries. It evaluates user votes, comments on those posts, and analyses post history modifications. Additionally, it uses window functions to rank posts per user, applies conditions for user feedback polarity, and provides insights into the stability or modification status of those posts. The usage of `COALESCE` and conditional aggregation explores some intricacies of NULL handling in SQL.
