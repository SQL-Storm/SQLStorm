-- Additional Considerations: 
-- The query showcases outer joins to encapsulate user votes and comments per post. It also utilizes window functions to rank posts,
-- aggregates for user votes, and string functions to concatenate commentersâ€™ names. The filtering criterion consolidates posts
-- based on various performance metrics ensuring potential benchmarks against specified conditions.
