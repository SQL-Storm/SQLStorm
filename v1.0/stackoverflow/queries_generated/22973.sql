### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
    - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by creation date per owner and computes total bounty associated with each post.
    - `PostDetails`: Uses the results of `RankedPosts` to collect additional post information, like the badge level based on user achievements and concatenating tags using `STRING_AGG`.

2. **Outer Joins and NULL Logic**:
    - The query employs `LEFT JOIN` to gather votes and post history, ensuring no data is lost from the main `Posts` data set.

3. **Window Functions**:
    - `ROW_NUMBER` and `SUM` as window functions to manage ranking and tallying bounties on posts over partitions.

4. **Complicated Predicates and Case Logic**:
    - Uses multiple CASE statements to define badge level and categorize traffic according to view count thresholds.

5. **Subquery and NULL Handling**:
    - Subqueries in the selection to count comments and summarize favorites from related posts, with `COALESCE` ensuring defaults are handled for potential NULLs.

6. **String Expressions**:
    - Tags are managed through string processing functions to convert the tags column into a more usable format.

7. **Traffic Category**:
    - A derived column categorizing posts based on traffic, showcasing a different kind of semantic interpretation of data fields.

This SQL query harnesses the many SQL features and constructs to create a performance benchmark that can stress the database engine with its complexity while extracting meaningful and rich data about posts from the StackOverflow schema.
