### Explanation:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  - `UserStats`: This CTE gathers statistics about users, including their reputation, number of posts, counts of upvotes and downvotes they received on their posts, and calculates average edit times for their posts.
  - `ClosedPosts`: This CTE counts how many posts each user has closed and concatenates the closure reasons into a single string for each user.

- **LEFT JOIN**: Both CTEs are joined together on the user ID to get the combined statistics.

- **COALESCE and NULL handling**: COALESCE is used to handle cases where there may not be any closed posts, defaulting to 0 for the count and 'No closures' for the reasons.

- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Provides a ranking system for users based on their reputation, allowing us to fetch only the top 10 ranked users.

- **Complex Aggregations**: The use of `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` and appropriate CASE statements make sure that only relevant votes and posts are considered.

- **STRING_AGG**: Aggregates closing reasons into a readable format.

The query effectively brings together a comprehensive view of user engagement through posts and their interactions in terms of closing posts on Stack Overflow, showcasing some intricate SQL techniques.
