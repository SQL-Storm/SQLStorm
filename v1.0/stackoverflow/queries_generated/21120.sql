This elaborate SQL query utilizes various constructs including CTEs for better organization and readability. It retrieves recent posts by users with a reputation greater than 1000, checking if those posts are associated with comments or if they have never been closed. It also ranks hot questions and collates relevant user information, along with employing complex null logic and multiple joins to create a well-structured dataset for benchmarking performance across this elaborate join scenario.
