This SQL query performs an intricate operation involving multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and employs various SQL constructs. It begins by defining the `RankedPosts` CTE to rank posts based on their score and creation date. Next, it collects comment counts in the `CommentCounts` CTE and combines that information in the `TopPostsComments` CTE to get the top posts along with their comment counts. The final SELECT statement then extracts the necessary information, including a case for comment availability and correlated subqueries to count upvotes and downvotes per post, ultimately limiting results to 10 entries sorted by score and view count. The logic and constructs involved make this query suitable for performance benchmarking and testing the SQL engine's capabilities.
