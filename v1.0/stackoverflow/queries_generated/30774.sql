This SQL query includes:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to track user reputation levels based on their votes.
- Various outer joins to pull information from related tables including posts, comments, badges, votes, post history, and post links.
- Conditional aggregation to count upvotes, downvotes, related posts, and edits.
- COALESCE to handle possible NULL values for titles, comments, and badges, ensuring we display meaningful defaults.
- A WHERE clause to filter users based on a minimum reputation threshold.
- Grouping and ordering to present a ranking of users based on reputation, along with limited output results.
