This query performs the following operations:

1. Defines Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to rank posts, gather user reputation and badge counts, filter frequent posts based on comments, and summarize post editing history.
2. Joins various data together to retrieve complex insights about posts and their corresponding users.
3. Applies a variety of predicates to filter results based on user reputation and post editing statistics.
4. Structures output with column selections which may contain NULL values, handled through `COALESCE`.
5. Orders the results based on reputation and creation date, implementing pagination via `OFFSET` and `FETCH`.
