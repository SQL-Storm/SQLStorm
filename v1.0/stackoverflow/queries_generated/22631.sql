This SQL query performs a multifaceted benchmarking analysis on users based on several criteria, including their reputation, total posts, bounties they have contributed, and statistics on their posts. It employs CTEs to segment the data logically, ensures robust handling of NULLs with COALESCE, and utilizes window functions for advanced analytics. The query also allows for the examination of close reasons along with post activity in recent times, thus adding multilevel complexity and data insight.
