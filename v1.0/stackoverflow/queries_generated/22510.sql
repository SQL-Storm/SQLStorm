This elaborate SQL query combines elements such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), correlated subqueries, outer joins, and groupings to create a complex data retrieval mechanism. It performs the following:

1. **RankedPosts CTE**: Generates a list of posts created in the last year, ranking them by the creation date per owner.
2. **PostWithComments CTE**: Joins the ranked posts with the count of comments, ensuring every post has a comment count even if it's zero.
3. **PopularTags CTE**: Counts the number of times each tag is associated with the popular posts filtered by a minimum occurrence threshold.
4. **UserReputation CTE**: Aggregates users' data, filtering for those with a reputation above 1000 and counting their badges.
5. **Final SELECT**: Retrieves users, their posts, and associated popular tags, applying various filters, including reputation range and scores above average.

This query effectively showcases various SQL functionalities, making it suitable for performance benchmarking while also exploring edge cases, such as the intricate handling of tags and user reputation filtering.
