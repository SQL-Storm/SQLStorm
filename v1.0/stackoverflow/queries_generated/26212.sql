This SQL query is designed to benchmark string processing and user activity in the context of Stack Overflow. It does the following:

1. **RankedPosts Common Table Expression (CTE):** This CTE ranks posts by their creation date per user for all questions, retaining related metadata such as the question title, body, and view count.

2. **TagsAnalysis CTE:** It extracts tags from the ranked posts, normalizes them using the `unnest` function, counts their occurrences, and limits the results to the 10 most frequently used tags.

3. **UserActivity CTE:** This CTE calculates the activity level of users who have asked questions, counting distinct questions asked, total views received, and upvotes received. It ranks users based on the number of questions.

4. **Final SELECT Statement:** It combines results from `UserActivity` and `TagsAnalysis`, filtering for the top five most active users and their engagement with the most popular tags. The query orders the results by the number of questions asked and total views to identify top contributors to the community.

This query leverages string processing functions and analytical functions, demonstrating demands on string manipulation, grouping, and ranking in SQL, making it suitable for benchmarking purposes.
