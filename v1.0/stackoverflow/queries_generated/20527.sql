### Explanation of Constructs Used:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Multiple CTEs (`RankedPosts`, `UserActivity`, `ClosedPosts`, `CombinedStats`) are used to structure the query logically, breaking it into manageable parts.
   
2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is employed to rank posts based on score and view count, allowing the selection of the top posts in the `CombinedStats`.

3. **Outer Joins**: The `LEFT JOIN` is used to gather potentially missing data from related tables (like votes and comments), ensuring all users and posts are represented appropriately.

4. **Aggregate Functions**: Usage of aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `COALESCE` to compile summary statistics on user activity.

5. **Complicated Predicates/Expressions**: The conditions in the `WHERE` clause demonstrate advanced filtering, including a dynamic timeframe for post creation.

6. **NULL Logic**: Handling of NULL values using `COALESCE` and conditional statements (e.g., to label posts based on close vote counts).

7. **String Expressions**: Use of `STRING_AGG` to create a comma-separated list of associated tags for each post.

8. **Unusual SQL Semantics**: Incorporation of various table references, nested queries, and case clauses to explore different aspects of post statistics while filtering out certain records creatively.

This query is designed to be elaborate for performance benchmarking across various SQL constructs while yielding insightful information about posts and users in the Stack Overflow schema.
