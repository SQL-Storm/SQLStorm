### Explanation of Constructs Used:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `UserStatistics`: Gathers aggregate statistics for users including their reputation and post/comment counts.
   - `PopularTags`: Identifies tags that have the highest post counts, enabling the selection of popular tags related to the userâ€™s posts.

2. **LEFT JOIN**:
   - Used for joining tables in cases where a user may not have any posts or where a post does not correspond to any tag.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**:
   - These are present in the `ON` clause for tag joins, ensuring that we only select users with active engagement based on their posts and reputation.

4. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Creates a rank for popular tags to allow the ordering of tags based on the count of associated posts.

5. **Complicated Predicates**:
   - Conditions within `WHERE` and `ON` clauses check combinations of user statistics, providing flexibility in filtering users by reputation or their total posts.

6. **NULL Logic**:
   - Use of `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values from left joins, ensuring that users without upvotes/downvotes/comments are still included.

7. **String Expressions**:
   - The `LIKE` clause uses string concatenation for dynamic pattern searching in the `Tags` field.

8. **Set Operators**:
   - Though not explicitly shown here as operators, the use of subqueries effectively filters out the maximum counts dynamically, acting as set conditions.

This SQL query highlights the complexity and interrelation of user statistics in a forum setting while ensuring performance is optimized through intelligent use of subqueries and CTEs.
