This SQL query is designed for performance benchmarking by extensively using various SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, correlated subqueries, and conditional expressions. The query first ranks posts based on their scores and creation dates, categorizes them, and assesses their interaction levels based on comment counts. Finally, it fetches the last edit details and organizes the selected posts accordingly. The logic includes edge cases like handling NULL values, conditionals for categorization, and derives insights into user engagement through interaction levels.
