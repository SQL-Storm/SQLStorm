This SQL query retrieves various statistics about users based on their posts and interactions in the Stack Overflow schema. It uses common table expressions (CTEs) to calculate post statistics and user statistics, including counts of upvotes, downvotes, comments, and actions taken to close posts. Furthermore, it computes the upvote percentage dynamically and categorizes users based on their reputation. The result set is ordered by multiple criteria to provide meaningful insights into user engagement patterns.
