This SQL query does the following:
1. It creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) to rank posts based on their score and view count, and calculates total votes.
2. It fetches relevant post history details such as the user who made changes and the type of change for those posts.
3. It gathers information about recent activity associated with each post, including the number of unique users involved and the count of changes.
4. It assesses users' reputations based on their badges.
5. Lastly, it selects posts with specific criteria, providing a comprehensive view of each post's interactions and statistics while accommodating NULL and edge cases.
