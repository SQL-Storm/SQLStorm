This query combines several advanced SQL constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), outer joins, window functions for ranking and row numbering, correlated subqueries, and complex predicates. It aggregates and filters post metrics while joining user data, aiming to provide a performance benchmark of posts that fit specific criteria. The inclusion of multiple corner cases allows for diverse results based on various user activities and post statuses, showcasing unusual SQL capabilities.
