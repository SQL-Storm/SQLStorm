This elaborate SQL query incorporates Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, aggregate functions with filters, and various expressions and predicates while analyzing posts from a specified schema. It selects top posts based on certain criteria within the last year, analyzes their comment and vote statistics, and evaluates the history of edits and status of the posts, all while considering edge cases and corner cases in data availability and relationships.
