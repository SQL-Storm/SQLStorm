This SQL query integrates various constructs including CTEs, aggregations, string functions, outer joins, nested subqueries, and sophisticated filtering logic, catering to the performance benchmarking an extensive dataset may require. It aims to provide insights into user activity, post history within the last month, and badge counts within the last yearâ€”all while accommodating NULL handling and employing just complex enough conditions to promote optimization challenges.
