### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts based on score and view count from the past year.
   - `UserPostStats`: Aggregates stats per user regarding post count, total views, and average score.
   - `PostClosureDetails`: Counts how many times a post has been closed and the first closure date.
   - `PopularTags`: Lists tags with more than 5 associated posts.

2. **Joins**:
   - Multiple outer joins are used to combine data across different aspects, ensuring that even if some data doesn't exist, the results aren't filtered out.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Utilizes `COALESCE` for NULL management, making sure that we have default values where needed.

4. **Ranking**:
   - `RANK()` window function is used to sort posts based on their performance, presenting only the top 10 per category.

5. **Bizarre Logic**:
   - Filter results ordering by view count first, then how many times they have been closed (with NULLs last), effectively bringing the more relevant posts to the top.

6. **Limiting and Offsetting**:
   - The final result set limits the output to 50 rows while allowing for pagination via the OFFSET clause.

This query covers performance benchmarking through its complexity, combining several advanced SQL constructs to create a rich, data-driven analysis of posts, users, and their activities on the Stack Overflow schema.
