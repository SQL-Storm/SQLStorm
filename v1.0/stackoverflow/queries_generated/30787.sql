This SQL query utilizes various constructs from the provided schema to achieve a multifaceted data retrieval aimed at performance benchmarking, including:

- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to gather hierarchical data about questions and their answers.
- Multiple `LEFT JOIN`s to aggregate comments, votes, and user badges, thereby illustrating various data relationships.
- The use of the `COALESCE` function to handle potential NULL values gracefully.
- The `STRING_AGG` function to concatenate strings for tags and post history comments.
- Proper ordering and limiting results for performance considerations.
