### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The query uses a recursive CTE (`RecursivePosts`) to gather questions and their corresponding answers, allowing us to maintain a hierarchy within the posts.
  
2. **Main Query**: The main query selects various details about the posts, such as title, view count, score, and the owner's reputation, along with a count of comments and related posts.

3. **LEFT JOINs**: The query uses multiple `LEFT JOINs` to connect with `Users`, `Badges`, `Comments`, and `PostLinks` to aggregate relevant information connected to each post.

4. **Filtering**: Thereâ€™s a `WHERE` condition to filter for posts created in the last 30 days.

5. **HAVING with Window Function**: It includes a `HAVING` clause that checks for posts whose average score is greater than 5, leveraging window functions.

6. **Pagination**: The query implements pagination to return only the top 10 posts ordered by score and view count. 

7. **NULL Logic**: The logic includes handling potential `NULL` values in badges counts using a `CASE` statement.

This query is designed to benchmark performance through its complexity and use of various SQL constructs.
