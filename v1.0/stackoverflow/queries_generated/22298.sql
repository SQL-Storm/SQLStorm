This SQL query involves several advanced features:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Multiple CTEs are used for organizing complex data retrieval.
2. **Outer Joins**: Leverage `LEFT JOIN` to gracefully handle missing data from related tables.
3. **Window Functions**: The `DENSE_RANK()` function is used to rank posts based on their score.
4. **Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` to concatenate string values and `COUNT()` for badges, providing a summary of relevant information.
5. **COALESCE**: Used throughout to handle potential `NULL` values, providing default values where data may not exist.
6. **Filtering**: Includes complicated predicates that take into account user reputation and voting behavior, helping to surface significant posts.
7. **Bizarre and Obscure Semantics**: The inclusion of conditions around post history and badges encourages complex relationships between users and their posts. 

This query benchmarks performance by pulling relevant data from multiple interconnected tables in an efficient manner, while still delivering detailed insight into popular posts.
