### Explanation of Constructs Used:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: This CTE ranks posts based on their score and counts comments, filtering only those created in the last year.
   - `PopularTags`: This aggregates tags with a minimum count and sums their respective bounties, considering only non-moderator tags.
   - `BountiedPosts`: This calculates total bounty for posts with a score of at least 10.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: Employed to gather supplementary data from comments and votes, ensuring that even posts without comments or votes are included.

3. **WHERE Clauses with Complex Logic**: Various conditions, including filtering by creation date, tag exclusion, and a score filter.

4. **Aggregations**: Utilizes `COUNT`, `SUM` and `COALESCE` for robust calculations, especially regarding potential `NULL` values from left joins.

5. **Window Functions**: `RANK()` is applied to categorize posts by score within their post type.

6. **String Functions**: Used `strpos()` to check for tag memberships—demonstrating complex relations between posts and tags in an unusual way.

7. **Nested Subqueries in JOINs**: These are leveraged to correlate tags with post IDs, illustrating the complexity of tag handling.

Overall, the query illustrates a sophisticated aggregation of data involving posts, users, votes, and tags with detailed logic for filtering and ranking results, lending itself well to performance benchmarking.
