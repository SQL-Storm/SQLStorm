This complex SQL query utilizes several advanced constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, and conditional logic to produce a detailed performance benchmark analysis of users and their recent posts on Stack Overflow. The results provide a ranked list of top users along with their most recent post statistics, allowing for an insightful performance evaluation based on user engagement and post activity.
