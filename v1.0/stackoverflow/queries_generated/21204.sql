This SQL query encompasses various SQL features:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It uses CTEs to create intermediate result sets, which are `RankedPosts`, `Closures`, and `UserBadges`.
  
2. **Window Functions**: Utilizes `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank posts within each post type and `COUNT()` to count posts per user.

3. **String Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG()` for concatenating close reasons and user badges.

4. **Outer Joins**: It uses `LEFT JOIN` to retrieve closure information and user badge counts even if there are no corresponding records.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause has conditions to filter based on user engagement and post popularity.

6. **NULL Logic**: Uses `COALESCE()` to handle potential NULL values for close counts and reasons.

7. **Pagination**: It incorporates pagination logic with `OFFSET` and `FETCH NEXT`.

This query can be performance benchmarked by examining its execution time against different datasets and measuring efficiency with indexing strategies.
