This SQL query retrieves statistics about users who have posted questions, including their total posts, upvotes, downvotes, and the number of answered questions. It makes use of a recursive CTE for hierarchy traversal, correlated subqueries, and aggregate functions alongside various joins and filters for performance benchmarking.
