This SQL query combines several advanced SQL features and constructs, such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregation with filtering, window functions for ranking, and correlating user votes with post analysis. It evaluates user activity and post engagement, particularly focusing on the recent posts and their interactions while analyzing user voting behavior, creating a comprehensive performance benchmark across different user interactions with posts. The corner cases include filtering with conditions within aggregated calculations and the use of NULL handling to ensure all relevant data contributes to analytics effectively.
