### Explanation of Constructs Used:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
    - `UserReputation`: Collects user data alongside their ranks based on reputation.
    - `TagStatistics`: Summarizes statistics about tag usage, specifically the number of questions and answers associated with each tag.
    - `PostDetails`: Gathers details about posts including close reasons and historical edits.

2. **Window Functions**:
    - `DENSE_RANK()` used to rank users by reputation.
    - `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank posts per user and filter the top 5 for each user.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**:
    - Leveraged in the `TagStatistics` CTE to dynamically aggregate tag data as related to posts.

4. **Outer Joins**:
    - Used in `PostDetails` to keep all posts even if they don't have a close reason.

5. **Complicated Predicates**:
    - The filtering logic in the final `SELECT` uses a combination of `AND`, `OR`, and `IS NULL` checks to handle various edge cases.

6. **Set Operators**:
    - While none are explicitly shown, the combination with `JOIN` and CTEs could be seen as a way to simulate set operations through the aggregation of results.

7. **NULL Logic**:
    - Used `COALESCE` to handle possible NULL values, particularly in timestamps to replace `LastAccessDate`.

8. **String Expressions**:
    - Used string manipulation functions to parse tags out of the `Tags` field.

This query showcases elaborate SQL features while also adhering to the specified schema.
