This query accomplishes several goals:
1. **CTE Usage**: It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create a multi-step process for filtering posts, ranking them, and aggregating comments.
2. **Window Functions**: It employs window functions to rank posts by score and to calculate upvotes and downvotes.
3. **Complex Filtering**: The CTE `FilteredPosts` applies complex predicates, ensuring posts score above a certain threshold or include the term 'SQL' in the title.
4. **NULL Handling**: It handles potential NULLs in the content using COALESCE to provide meaningful default values.
5. **String Aggregation**: The `STRING_AGG` function collects comments related to each post into a single string, separated by a semicolon for easier readability.
6. **Outer Joins**: It uses left joins to ensure that all posts in the filtered set are included even if they lack comments.
7. **Dynamic Time Range Filtering**: The posts are filtered based on their creation date to include only those from the last year, which can help focus on relevant and recent content. 

This elaborate query leverages many aspects of SQL while focusing on practical requirements for performance benchmarking.
