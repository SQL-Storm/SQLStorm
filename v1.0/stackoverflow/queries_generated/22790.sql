This query constructs a complex performance benchmarking SQL statement that includes:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive post history and filtered posts.
- Correlated subqueries joining users' ranking on reputation to the last editor information connected to posts.
- Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` to rank posts based on comments and user's reputation.
- Incorporation of multiple joins, aggregations, and complicated predicates to accurately analyze posts created within the last year while checking for closure status and the last user who edited them.
- A uniqueness check to ensure that only distinct values are processed.
