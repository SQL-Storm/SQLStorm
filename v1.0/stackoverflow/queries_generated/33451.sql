This SQL query implements several constructs for performance benchmarking:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Three CTEs are defined: `RankedPosts`, `PostStatistics`, and `TopUsers` to organize the data processing logically.

2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a rank to each post per user, while `RANK()` helps in ranking users based on their total score.

3. **Aggregates**: Count, sum, and average functions provide insights on users' contributions.

4. **Outer Join**: A LEFT JOIN is used to include all users, filtering the results based on whether they meet the criteria for reputation or if they have questions.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The WHERE clause contains logical conditions to evaluate user reputation and the presence of questions.

6. **Sorting**: The final output is ordered by user rank, with null values appearing last.

This combination of constructs allows for a nuanced analysis of posts, users, and their contributions to the platform.
