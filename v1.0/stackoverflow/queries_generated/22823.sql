This query includes a Common Table Expression (CTE) for ranking posts based on their score and view count while counting comments and up/down votes. It also gathers trending tags by popularity and allows for additional expressions to categorize post popularity while counting the total number of tags in the system. It employs outer joins, window functions for ranking, advanced predicates, and handles scenarios where tags may or may not exist for certain posts.
