This SQL query incorporates several interesting constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Using `WITH` for `RankedPosts` and `MergedPosts` helps organize the query logically.
2. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank posts by view count per user, while `MAX()` is also employed to separately aggregate data.
3. **Outer Join**: A `LEFT JOIN` is used to include potentially absent data for accepted answers.
4. **Correlated Subquery**: The `IN` subquery links users to their posts.
5. **Lateral Joins**: Implements a lateral join to split the tags in each post into individual entries for aggregation.
6. **Aggregations**: The use of `AVG` and `ARRAY_AGG` aggregates comment scores and tag names.
7. **NULL Logic**: The `COALESCE` function handles NULL values throughout by providing defaults.
8. **Filtering with ARRAY_AGG**: The query maintains aggregation of tag names while filtering out NULLs seamlessly.

This detailed SQL demonstrates complex relationships and a multifaceted data retrieval process well-suited for performance benchmarking scenarios.
