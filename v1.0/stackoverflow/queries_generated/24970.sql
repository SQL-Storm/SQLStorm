This elaborate SQL query combines various advanced SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions for ranking, outer joins, NULL handling in aggregates, and conditions that introduce different logic based on the presence of comments and post closure, all while benchmarking user contributions and post statistics.
