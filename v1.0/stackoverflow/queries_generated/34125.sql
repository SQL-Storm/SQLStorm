This SQL query uses several constructs including:

1. **Recursive CTE**: To build a hierarchy of posts based on parent-child relationships.
2. **Aggregations**: Counting total posts and badges, summing view counts, and averaging scores.
3. **Window Functions**: Utilizing `DENSE_RANK` to rank users based on views grouped by post levels.
4. **LEFT JOINs**: To gather information from the `Users`, `Posts`, `Badges`, and `Votes` tables.
5. **NULL Logic**: Using `COALESCE` to handle cases where there are no votes on a post.
6. **STRING_AGG**: To concatenate associated tags from posts into a single string.
7. **HAVING Clause**: Filtering results to include only users with significant activity. 

This complex query serves to benchmark the performance of SQL execution with multiple joins, aggregations, and recursive logic.
