This SQL query is designed to analyze user contributions on a Stack Overflow-like platform, focusing particularly on users' badges and post statistics. Hereâ€™s a summary of the query breakdown:

1. **CTE - UserBadges**: This recursive common table expression collects badge information for each user, assigning a rank based on the date the badge was earned.

2. **CTE - PostStats**: This CTE aggregates post information, including comment counts and vote counts on posts created from the year 2020 onwards, through the use of outer joins.

3. **CTE - TopUsers**: This CTE calculates overall user metrics, filtering to include only users with a significant number of views (more than 1000).

4. **FinalResult CTE**: This CTE combines the top users with their most recent badge and ranks them based on their total upvotes received.

5. **Final SELECT**: The final result generates a list of users displaying contributor types and limiting the result set to the top 50 users based on upvotes, along with relevant details like badge and contribution statistics.
