This SQL query retrieves statistics about users based on their post activity, scores, and interactions with closed posts. It implements several advanced SQL features:

- **Recursive CTE**: Used for hierarchical queries (might be unnecessary for simple aggregation here but included for complexity).
- **Window Functions**: Calculating ranks based on `TotalScore` and `PostCount`.
- **Left Joins**: To include all users, even those without posts or votes, ensuring full visibility of the data.
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Using `SUM` with `CASE` statements for different post counts.
- **COALESCE**: Proper handling of null values.
- **Complex Predicate Logic**: Filtering only significant users and categorizing scores.
- **Ordering and Limiting**: To fetch the top 10 active users. 

The query is designed to evaluate user engagement in a Stack Overflow-like environment, focusing on performance benchmarking.
