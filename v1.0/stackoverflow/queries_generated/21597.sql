### Explanation:
- **CTEs**:
  - `RankedPosts`: Ranks the posts for each user that have a reputation greater than 100, ordered by creation date, to get the latest post for each user (`rn = 1`).
  - `FilteredTags`: Retrieves tags with more than 5 associated posts, which helps filter out less relevant tags.
  - `PostHistoryInfo`: Collects closure information for posts, including the number of closure votes and the earliest closure date.

- **Joins**:
  - It uses `LEFT JOIN` to incorporate tag information and closure votes, ensuring that posts without these attributes are still included.

- **Predicates/Expressions**:
  - The `LIKE` operator with `||` syntax to concatenate the tag names provides a dynamic way to evaluate tag relevance.
  
- **COALESCE**: 
  - It ensures that if no closures are found, the output will show `0`.

- **Ordering and Limiting**: 
  - Finally, the results are ordered first by score and then by view count, limiting the output to the top 10 posts which help identify those likely most pertinent during performance benchmarking.

This query demonstrates various SQL features such as window functions, CTEs, conditional aggregation, and complex joins, addressing semantical complexities within the schema provided.
