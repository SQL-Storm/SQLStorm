This SQL query utilizes several advanced SQL constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, string operations, and conditional logic. It fetches user participation in posts over a year while considering the activity and contention status of the posts. Specific predicates and intricate string aggregations enhance the complexity of the query.

Note: Please ensure that the syntax conforms to your specific SQL dialect, as certain functions or operations may vary slightly.
