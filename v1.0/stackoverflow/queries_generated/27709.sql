-- This SQL query benchmarks string processing by examining posts, tags, and related user information.
-- It calculates the number of posts, their average score, and the total number of unique tags used along with user reputation statistics.

This query performs the following operations:
1. **TagData CTE**: Combines posts with their associated tags and user reputation.
    - Filters posts from the current year.
    - Uses string processing (`POSITION` function) to identify posts containing each tag.
   
2. **PostStats CTE**: Calculates overall statistics from `TagData`, including total posts, average length of the post body, average reputation of users who created the posts, and total tags associated.

3. **Final Selection**: Selects statistics from `PostStats` and counts posts that have a complexity indicator (more than three tags linked to them). 

This query provides detailed insights into user engagement and the complexity of content in the StackOverflow database, thereby benchmarking the performance of string processing operations.
