This query benchmarks posts created in the last 30 days, calculating various metrics such as vote scores, edit counts, and the number of unique editors. It leverages Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for organized data retrieval and uses window functions to rank posts by score, along with several joins and conditional logic to address obscure edge cases such as posts with no votes or edits. The final result set includes insights into the overall sentiment of the votes alongside the status of the posts, encapsulating a rich dataset for performance analysis.
