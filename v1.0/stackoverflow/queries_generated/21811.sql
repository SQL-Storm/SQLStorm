This elaborate SQL query demonstrates various SQL constructs, including CTEs, LEFT JOINs, conditional aggregation, window functions, correlated subqueries, and a UNION operation. It retrieves statistical information about users and their posts while also considering edge cases, such as the absence of closed posts and nuanced conditions based on reputation and voting activity.
