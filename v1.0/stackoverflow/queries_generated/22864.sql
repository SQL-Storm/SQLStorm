### Explanation:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `PostDetails` aggregates data from `Posts`, `Comments`, `Votes`, and `Tags` to collect comprehensive data about each post.
2. **LEFT JOINs**: These join various tables (Comments for comment counts, Votes for upvote/downvote counts, Tags for tags associated with each post).
3. **COALESCE**: This is used to handle potential NULL values for counts appropriately.
4. **STRING_AGG**: This aggregates tag names into a single string for each post.
5. **ROW_NUMBER**: This window function ranks posts per user based on the date of creation.
6. **Subqueries**: These provide additional counts for closed/open posts and deleted/undeleted posts.
7. **CASE statements**: Used to create a user-friendly status message for the answers associated with the post.
8. **WHERE clauses**: Filters results to show only the latest posts with a positive score. 
9. **ORDER BY**: The final selection is sorted based on score and creation date to prioritize high-scoring and recent posts.

This query uses advanced SQL features to combine complex aggregations and filters for performance benchmarking, showcasing the power and intricacies of SQL.
