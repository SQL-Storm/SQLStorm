This query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs) to gather statistics about users, posts, votes, and activity levels. It takes advantage of outer joins, aggregation functions, and string aggregation to offer a comprehensive view of posts created by users with a particular badge count and activity level, sorted by their score difference. Cases of NULL handling are addressed, and filtering based on recent activity is included for clarity and performance benchmarking.
