### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
    - **RankedPosts**: Ranks posts by their creation date for each user while selecting relevant fields. Closed posts are checked with a `COALESCE` to ensure we have a comparably high futuristic timestamp.
    - **UserBadges**: Counts badges for users, separating them into Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges.
    - **PostHistoryExtended**: Aggregates the post history for edit dates and counts.

2. **Main Select Query**: Joins RankedPosts with PostHistoryExtended and UserBadges, applying multiple conditions to filter the final results based on score and view count while checking the postâ€™s status as well.

3. **Window Functions**: Utilizes `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()`, allowing sorting and ranking of rows within partitioned data.

4. **UNIQUE Pagination**: Uses a random offset to create a unique pagination experience for tablet views.

5. **Complicated Predicate Logic**: Combines various predicates in the `WHERE` clause to filter posts based on their status and interaction level. 

This query serves to provide insights into user engagement through posts, taking into account their activity history and badge count, offering a mix of ranking and summarization across different metrics.
