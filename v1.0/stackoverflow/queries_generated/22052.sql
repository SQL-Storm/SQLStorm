This elaborate SQL query achieves several objectives:

1. **CTEs**: It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break complex logic into manageable parts.
2. **Window Functions**: It applies `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` to rank votes on posts and create a hierarchy of posts based on their engagement.
3. **Correlated Subqueries**: It uses a lateral join with a string expression to expand tags into rows for aggregation.
4. **Complicated Filtering Logic**: The `HAVING` clause uses `NULLIF` to conditionally filter posts by their vote count while still allowing those with comments.
5. **NULL Logic**: It operates with potential NULL values related to voting and counts, ensuring consistent logical flow.
6. **String Expressions**: The query utilizes `STRING_AGG` to concatenate tags for each post efficiently.

The resulting data can be used for performance benchmarking against various post types, popularity metrics, or user engagement analysis on a Stack Overflow-like platform.
