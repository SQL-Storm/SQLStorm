This query benchmarks string processing by leveraging the `Tags` column in the `Posts` table to generate statistics, including counts of posts, accepted answers, average scores of those posts, and lists of contributors for each tag. The results are ranked and filtered to provide the top 10 tags based on post count while displaying their average score.
