This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. **CTEs**:
   - **RankedPosts**: Ranks posts by score for each post owner within the last year.
   - **PostStats**: Aggregates data for each post including comment counts and total bounties.
   - **MaxViews**: Obtains the maximum view count from the posts.
   - **BountyDetails**: Classifies bounty levels for further analysis.

2. **Cases and Joins**:  
   - Utilizes `CASE` to categorize posts based on their rank and bounty level.
   - Joins diverse tables, making remarks on bounty inclusivity.

3. **Final Selection**: 
   - Fetches posts with more than average views or those with bounties, providing a top-tier interface for performance benchmarks in the schema.

4. **Aggregate Functions**: Counts comments and sums bounties.

5. **Window Functions**: Ranks posts while maintaining an interactive look at user impact.

6. **Outer Joins**: Used to ensure that all posts—including those without owners or votes—are included.

7. **Advanced NULL Handling**: Takes care of potential NULLs in bounty calculations and presents clear categorizations.

8. **Order and Limit**: Orders final results by views and comment counts and limits output to 100 records. 

This complex query explores multiple facets of the data while offering effective performance benchmarking.
