### Explanation:
1. **CTEs**: Several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts per user based on their creation date and calculates the total score of all posts.
   - `UserReputationHistory`: Retrieves users' reputations and categorizes them.
   - `FilteredPosts`: Joins the ranked posts with user reputations, applying a filter for rank and view count.
   - `PostStats`: Aggregates statistics for posts in the `FilteredPosts`.

2. **SELECT Statement**: The main query selects from `FilteredPosts`, also accessing `PostStats` to get aggregate data. It categorizes posts based on their scores compared to the highest score.

3. **Comment Count**: A correlated subquery counts comments related to the specific post.

4. **Bizarre Logic**: The use of reputation categories, performance statuses, and the comparison of scores across filtered views gives complexity.

5. **String and NULL Logic**: The `CASE` statement contains multiple conditions handling potential NULL values and evaluations.

6. **Pagination**: The query fetches a limited number of results (10), which is useful for performance benchmarking in large datasets.
