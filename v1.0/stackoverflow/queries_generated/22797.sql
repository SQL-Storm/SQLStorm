This query demonstrates a complex structure that includes several advanced SQL features:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Two CTEs have been created â€“ `UserReputation` that categorizes users based on their reputation, and `PostStatistics` that aggregates data on posts.
  
2. **Correlated Subqueries**: The aggregation within the `PostStatistics` CTE correlates to comments and votes related to each post.

3. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` function ranks posts by their score within each post type.

4. **Outer Joins**: The `LEFT JOIN` is employed to include posts even if they have no comments or votes.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: Conditions in the main `SELECT` query filter for certain criteria based on user creation and location status.

6. **NULL Logic**: The query includes a check for users with non-null locations.

7. **Bizarre Semantic Constructs**: The categorization of user reputation with a string expression adds an unconventional layer, while the overall structure combines several data points in a meaningful but complex way.

This SQL query would allow for performance benchmarking by measuring the execution time with different dataset sizes and structures.
