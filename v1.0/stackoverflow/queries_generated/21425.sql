### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts per user and categorizes with a score.
   - `FilteredPosts`: Filters those posts with more than average comments and non-zero bounty.
   - `TopFivePosts`: Fetches the top posts in terms of score with the 'High' score category.

2. **String Manipulation**: 
   - The tags are extracted using `string_to_array` and `UNNEST`, which converts the comma-separated tag string into individual entries. 

3. **Window Functions**: 
   - Both `ROW_NUMBER()` functions are used to rank posts by score and to define top ranks.

4. **Conditional Logic and Filtering**: 
   - Posts are further filtered to only return those tagged with at least 3 distinct tags.

5. **Aggregation**: 
   - The results aggregate the tags using `STRING_AGG`, providing a single string with all distinct tags for each resulting post.

6. **Unusual Semantics**: 
   - The use of `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` allows for correlated subqueries or functions that are run for each row in the main query, a somewhat obscure but powerful SQL construct.

This query is suitable for performance benchmarking, showcasing the database's ability to handle complex joins, aggregations, and analytical functions.
