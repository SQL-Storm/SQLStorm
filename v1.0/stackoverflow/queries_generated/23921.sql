-- Note: The query above showcases various SQL constructs including:
-- 1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for organizing and breaking down complex queries.
-- 2. Outer joins to include all relevant entities even when there may not be a direct match.
-- 3. Window functions to rank posts by creation date.
-- 4. Aggregate functions to summarize data about badges and tags.
-- 5. String manipulation in JOINs with a LIKE clause for tag matching.
-- 6. Bizarre predicates, such as using `STRING_AGG` and handling NULL logic across various table relationships.
