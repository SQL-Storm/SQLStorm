This SQL query is an elaborate performance benchmarking query that performs the following operations:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Builds a hierarchy of posts, starting with questions and branching into answers, while tracking their levels of depth.
2. **Top Voted Posts CTE**: Identifies the most viewed questions ranked by view count.
3. **User Badge Counts CTE**: Computes the number of badges for each user and segregates them by type (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
4. **Main Query**: Combines the results from the CTEs:
    - Joins to get user display names.
    - Filters to only include users with badges.
    - Ranks posts based on view count, while deciphering whether the post is a question or an answer based on its level in the hierarchy.
5. **Final Output**: Returns a comprehensive view of post details, including title, view count, user badge information, and post types, ordered by view count and creation date.
