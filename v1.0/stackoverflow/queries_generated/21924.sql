This SQL query performs a series of operations including common table expressions (CTEs) to analyze closed posts while also calculating vote statistics and user reputations. The final output includes information about the moderator's activities in closing posts, alongside an aggregated summary of all closed posts. It cleverly handles corner cases by checking for reopened or undeleted posts, ensuring thorough performance benchmarking in a query.
