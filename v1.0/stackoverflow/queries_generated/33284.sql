### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Two CTEs are created:
   - **TaggedPosts**: Recursively finds posts and their tags. It begins with questions tagged with any tag and traverses linked-related posts to calculate different levels of related questions.
   - **RankedUsers**: Aggregates user data to find the total bounties and the number of questions they've answered, ranking them according to how many bounties they've received.

2. **Main Query**: This selects from `TaggedPosts` and joins with `RankedUsers` to link posts to their leading answerers based on their score. It checks if the owner of the answer is the same as the ranked user. 

3. **LEFT JOIN**: Used to ensure we get all tagged posts even if thereâ€™s no relevant user who answered them.

4. **COALESCE and NULL Logic**: Handles potential NULL values from the joins. If a post has no answers, still it will be included but might show a NULL for the user information.

5. **ORDER BY and FETCH**: The results are ordered by post score and view count to prioritize popular and high-engagement questions and limited to 100 results for better performance.

This query is crafted for an intriguing performance benchmarking scenario, combining complexity through recursion, ranking, and filtering across multiple tables.
