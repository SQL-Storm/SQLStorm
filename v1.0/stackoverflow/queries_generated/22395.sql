This query generates a comprehensive view of posts made in the last year, summarizing user badges and engagement metrics. It uses common table expressions (CTEs), outer joins, correlated subqueries, window functions, and conditional logic to filter results and compute user types based on badge counts, as well as metrics like views, votes, and comments.
