### Query Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by their creation date and computes upvote/downvote counts.
   - `CommentSummary`: Aggregates comments per post.
   - `MergedData`: Combines rank and comment data, along with an adjusted score.
   - `FilteredPosts`: Categorizes posts based on the adjusted score and comment count.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Selects posts with the category 'Hot Post' from `FilteredPosts`.
   - Includes additional calculations like the count of accepted answers and a list of tags related to the post.

3. **Use of Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER` and counts for upvotes/downvotes per post show advanced analytical capabilities.

4. **Subquery Usage**: Demonstrates use of subqueries for calculating accepted answers and aggregating related tags.

5. **Complicated Predicate Logic**: Filtering and categorizing posts based on several conditions enhances complexity.

6. **String Aggregation**: The usage of `STRING_AGG` illustrates a method of concatenating tag names and comments into a manageable format.

7. **NULL Logic**: COALESCE is utilized to handle potentially null comment counts gracefully.

This query employs a variety of SQL constructs demonstrating a complex example of performance benchmarking scenarios within the provided schema.
