### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE**: It aggregates votes and comment counts, creating a subquery results table that includes a row number for each user's posts. The inclusion of `COALESCE` ensures that we account for posts without votes or comments.

2. **Post Ranking**: The `PostRank` column classifies whether the post is 'Latest' or 'Earlier' depending on its position per user based on creation date.

3. **Main Query**: Fetches user display names and filters posts with more upvotes than downvotes, joined with the `Users` table.

4. **Previous Posts Count**: Nested subquery is utilized to count the total number of posts created by the user before the current post date.

5. **Tags Aggregation**: It retrieves tags related to each post using a correlated subquery that accounts for posts and their associated tags.

6. **Post History Join**: The query features an outer join that gathers the latest edit information and combines it with the main post details, checking for accepted answers.

7. Uses DISTINCT SQL aggregate functions, allowing for various calculations and ensuring that NULL values don't cause issues in the result set.

This complex approach utilizes various SQL constructs and ensures rich semantic corner cases are handled, including considerations for posts with no tags, no comments, or users with no edits.
