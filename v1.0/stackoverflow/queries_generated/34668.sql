This query retrieves a hierarchy of posts (specifically questions), their details, and associated metrics including user upvotes, downvotes, and comment counts. The use of a recursive CTE allows exploration of a post's answers and their associated comments in a tree-like structure. It also integrates information about the owners (users) and their badges, while filtering pertinent results based on view and interaction counts.
