This SQL query performs multiple complex operations, including the following:

1. Utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to rank posts by user and aggregate votes for each post.
2. Joins on comments to determine the number of comments on each post and filters the results based on closure statuses.
3. Combines conditional aggregation and NULL handling with `COALESCE` to address cases where there may be no votes or comments.
4. Implements a quirky logic to determine the `PostStatus`, taking into account the nuances of closure and reopening dates.
5. Calculates how many high-reputation users were engaged with each post, further adding another layer of complexity. 

This intricate structure is ideal for performance benchmarking, showcasing various SQL functionalities while managing obscure corner cases.
