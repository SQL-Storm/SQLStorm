This SQL query accomplishes the following:

- Utilizes a recursive common table expression (CTE) to gather statistics on posts and their answers.
- Pulls user statistics from the `Users` table, aggregating metrics related to posts and votes.
- Uses `COALESCE` to handle potential `NULL` values when summing votes.
- Includes string aggregation of tags related to each post using `STRING_AGG`.
- Filters users with a minimum reputation and posts created within the last year, ensuring the analysis is focused on recent activity.
- Ensures only users with a significant number of posts are included in the results.
- Orders the results by reputation to highlight the most reputable users.
