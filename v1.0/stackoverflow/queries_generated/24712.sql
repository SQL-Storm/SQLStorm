This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. Generates a ranked list of posts by their view counts, while aggregating their upvotes and downvotes.
2. Includes correlated subqueries to fetch tags associated with each post and conditionally determines if the post is 'Closed' or 'Open'.
3. Calculates aggregate statistics like average upvotes, downvotes, and counts of closed and open posts using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
4. Applies a filter clause incorporating various conditions involving NULL checks, ensuring only posts exceeding a certain threshold of average statistics are included in the final output.

This intricate structure leverages outer joins, window functions, subqueries, and complex predicates, creating a comprehensive querying scenario that can demonstrate performance under various conditions.
