This SQL query consists of various advanced constructs ensuring complexity for performance benchmarking. It uses:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Recursive CTE for post history and user badges aggregation.
2. **Window Functions**: To rank revisions and calculate aggregate user badge counts.
3. **Outer Joins**: To include posts that might not have any comments or votes.
4. **Filtering Logic**: Using HAVING to ensure only posts with multiple revisions or significant user badges are included.
5. **Aggragation Functions**: COUNT, SUM, and STRING_AGG for deriving various statistics.

It showcases intricate SQL semantics applicable in performance tuning and examining how different constructs interact with each other.
