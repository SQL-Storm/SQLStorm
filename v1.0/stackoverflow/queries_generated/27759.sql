### Explanation:
- This query begins with a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedPosts`, which retrieves posts from the `Posts` table that are questions (PostTypeId = 1) created in the last year. It counts the number of answers associated with each post and aggregates the tags related to those posts.
  
- Another CTE called `UserReputation` fetches users with their reputation, ranking them based on reputation score.

- Finally, the main query selects from `RankedPosts` and joins on `UserReputation`, filtering to only include posts with more than 5 answers, and orders the results by the number of answers and reputation of the poster. This provides a list of the top 10 posts that have engaged a lot of interaction and are from high-reputation users, useful for understanding trends in string processing related to user interactions on a platform like Stack Overflow.
