This query benchmarks string processing by analyzing how different tags are related to posts, calculating aggregate metrics for the posts associated with each tag, and then correlating these tags to users based on their contributions. The results give you insights into the most popular tags together with the top contributors to those tags based on the number of views and user reputation.
