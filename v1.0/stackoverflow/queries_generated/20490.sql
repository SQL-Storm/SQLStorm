This elaborate SQL query utilizes several advanced SQL features, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions for ranking posts, outer joins for gathering closure reason and user voting information, and conditional logic to categorize the engagement status of each post. It blends the complexities of user activity monitoring with post history to derive insights on popular posts while also considering corner cases where scores or view counts could be NULL.
