This SQL query performs a benchmark analysis of the string processing capability within the schema, focusing on tags associated with posts. It aggregates data on the number of posts, total views, average scores, top contributors, and total bounties for each tag. The query then ranks the tags by their performance metrics and returns the top 5 tags either by total views or by post count, sorted by their highest rank between the two.
