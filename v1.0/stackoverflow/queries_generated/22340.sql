This SQL query includes:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It uses multiple CTEs to organize the data into logical sections. `RankedPosts` ranks posts for each user, `UserStats` aggregates user statistics, and `UserTopPosts` fetches top posts per user.

2. **Window Functions**: It incorporates the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank posts and users dynamically based on scores.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Subqueries within the `SELECT` for calculating total upvotes and downvotes per user.

4. **Complicated predicates**: It includes multiple filtering conditions based on various criteria such as creation date, and post attributes like title/body being non-null.

5. **NULL Logic**: It handles potential null values gracefully using `COALESCE` and conditions like `IS NOT NULL`.

6. **String Expressions & Conditions**: User selection based on specific conditions derived from their names.

The overall goal of this query is to benchmark performance through complexity while retrieving meaningful aggregated data about posts and user interactions from the Schema.
