-- This query benchmarks the performance of complex joins and aggregations,
-- using CTEs for readability and performance optimizations. It also 
-- demonstrates various SQL constructs like window functions, string 
-- manipulations, and advanced CASE statements, pushing the 
-- boundaries of typical SQL semantics.
