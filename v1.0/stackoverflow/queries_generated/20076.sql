This elaborate SQL query utilizes multiple advanced SQL constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, conditional case statements, outer joins, and correlated subqueries. It begins by recursively identifying posts and calculating ranks, followed by aggregating user statistics and commenting metrics. Finally, it generates a detailed output that includes discussion and reputation levels, all while performing a ranked order based on view count and total score.
