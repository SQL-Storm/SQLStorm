This query is a complex demonstration of various SQL constructs including common table expressions (CTEs), correlated subqueries, LEFT joins, CASE statements, and window functions, all while applying a range of filtering and ranking conditions. It showcases user reputation levels, post statistics, and incorporates post history along with condition-based ranking to derive user status based on contributions.
