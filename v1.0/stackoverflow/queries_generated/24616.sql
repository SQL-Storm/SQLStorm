-- Additional cemetery queries can be applied here depending on the benchmarking needs.
This SQL query uses various constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for organizational clarity, window functions to rank posts per user, correlated subqueries for user statistics, and outer joins for post history data. The selection criteria cater to multiple conditions, showcasing complex predicates. Finally, pagination is used for fetching a limited set of results suitable for performance testing.
