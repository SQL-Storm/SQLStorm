-- Considerations:
-- 1. Using COALESCE to manage NULL logic for closed posts.
-- 2. Joining multiple CTEs to gather comprehensive data on posts, users, and closure reasons.
-- 3. Utilizing window functions for ranking posts based on user.
-- 4. Set operations apply indirectly through aggregation and conditional logic.
-- 5. Handling complex scenarios in a clear yet elaborate manner for effective benchmarking.
