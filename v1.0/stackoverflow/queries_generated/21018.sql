This query achieves multiple objectives such as:

- Ranking posts per user to display only the top three posts.
- Aggregating tags associated with the posts.
- Identifying recently closed posts.
- Counting badges for users with a reputation over a specific threshold.
- Using conditional logic to categorize posts based on their status.
- Combines several advanced SQL features and structure.
