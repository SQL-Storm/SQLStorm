### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`RecursivePostHierarchy`)**: This CTE is used to build a hierarchy of posts. It starts from posts with no parents (i.e., root posts), and recursively appends child posts, creating a full path (title hierarchy) from the top parent to each child.

2. **Ranked CTE (`RankedPosts`)**: This organizes posts per user, ranking them based on score. It uses row numbering to determine the top posts for each user.

3. **Main Query**: 
   - It joins the `Users` table with the `RankedPosts`, using a LEFT JOIN which allows retrieving users who may not have posts.
   - It limits the output to the top 5 ranked posts per user.
   - It includes subqueries to count comments and votes specifically for each post.

4. **Sorting**: The final result is sorted by user reputation first, then post score, and finally the hierarchical title.

5. **NULL Logic**: The use of `COALESCE` ensures that if a post doesn't have a title in the recursive hierarchy, it defaults to 'No Title'.

6. **Performance Benchmarking**: The constructs used, such as CTEs, window functions, and subqueries, can create a rich data retrieval scenario that is useful for performance analysis and optimization. 

The query aims to explore both depth of data relationships (with recursion) and breadth of user engagement with posts, ideal for performance benchmarking in SQL Server environments.
