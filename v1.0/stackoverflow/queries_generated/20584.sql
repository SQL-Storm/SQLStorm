This SQL query builds upon concepts of CTEs, outer joins, correlated subqueries, and window functions to derive user and post statistics while incorporating unusual behavior with aggregates and string expressions. It also includes NULL handling and intricate filtering criteria to capture a rich dataset relevant for performance benchmarking.
