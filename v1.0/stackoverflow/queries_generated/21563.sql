This SQL query encompasses several advanced SQL constructs and operations including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, correlated subqueries, and complex aggregations. It is designed for performance benchmarking, targeting users with a minimum reputation, their active participation in terms of posts and answers, and additionally providing insights into their performance metrics, badges earned, and associated tags. The query aims to capture eccentricities within the Stack Overflow schema while also presenting a multifaceted view of user engagement in a coherent manner.
