### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - **RankedPosts**: Gathers post information with net score calculation for questions posted in the last year, counting their comments while ranking by creation date per user.
   - **ActiveUsers**: Identifies users active within the last six months, ranking them by reputation.
   - **RelatedPosts**: Retrieves titles of related posts linked through `PostLinks`. If none are found, it defaults to a placeholder.

2. **Main SELECT**: Combines post data with active user and related post information, filtering for posts with significant interaction.

3. **JOINs**: 
   - An inner join merges `RankedPosts` and `ActiveUsers`, ensuring only posts by highly ranked active users are considered.
   - A left join brings in related posts while maintaining the core set of active posts.

4. **WHERE Clause Conditions**: Ensures that results meet specific criteria for comments and net scoreâ€”highlighting interaction.

5. **Ordering and Limiting**: Results are sorted by net score and comment count, showing dynamic and engaging posts first, limited to the top 20 to maintain focus.

This query illustrates sophisticated SQL techniques like CTEs, window functions, conditional aggregations, and logic handling for related dataset extraction, showcasing a blend of complexity and utility for performance benchmarks.
