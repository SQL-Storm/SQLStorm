This SQL query is designed to benchmark performance by utilizing several advanced SQL constructs. It:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `UserBadges`: Retrieves users and their badge information.
   - `TopPosts`: Selects top-ranked posts by score for each user.
   - `ClosedPosts`: Gathers closed posts with relevant closure reasons.

2. **Window Functions**: The ROW_NUMBER function ranks posts within their respective user groups based on score.

3. **Aggregations**: Utilizing `COUNT` and `STRING_AGG` to compile badge counts and close reasons.

4. **LEFT JOINs**: To ensure that we capture all users with badges, even if they don't have a post or closed post to join against.

5. **Correlated Subqueries**: To count comments and votes dynamically for each post.

6. **NULL Logic**: Handling cases where there are no closed posts or badges accurately.

7. **Complicated predicates**: Using conditions that involve multiple criteria to filter users and posts effectively.

8. **Ordering and Limiting**: Ensures the output is manageable and sorted by relevance.

This combination of features creates a comprehensive and performant query that can serve both as a benchmark and as a statement of SQL complexity.
