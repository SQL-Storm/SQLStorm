### Explanation of the Query Components:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**:
   - The `RecursivePostCTE` gathers all questions (PostTypeId = 1) and their accepted answers recursively to account for any possible nesting.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The main body of the query aggregates data from the `Users` and `Posts` tables.
   - `LEFT JOIN` is used to fetch user data even if the user has no questions or accepted answers.
   - The use of `LATERAL` helps to handle the parsing of tags directly from `Posts.Tags`, utilizing `UNNEST`.

3. **Aggregations**:
   - The query calculates the total number of questions and accepted answers for each user.
   - It sums the scores of accepted answers, aggregates tags used, finds the last question's date, and averages the time taken to accept an answer.

4. **Filtering and Ordering**:
   - The `HAVING` clause ensures that only users with more than 5 questions are included.
   - The final result is ordered by `TotalAcceptedScore` in descending order, showing the most effective users first.

5. **Limit**: 
   - The query limits the results to the top 10 users based on the total accepted score.

This query combines various SQL constructs in an engaging manner, demonstrating both complexity and efficiency in handling performance benchmarking tasks.
