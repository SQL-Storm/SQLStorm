This SQL query aims to retrieve detailed performance metrics about users who answer questions on a site with good engagement. It employs various SQL constructs:

- **Recursive CTE** to manage post relationships between questions and answers.
- **LEFT JOINs** with LATERAL to split tags into a single string for aggregation.
- **Aggregate Functions** such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG combined with **string aggregation** for tag names.
- **CASE expressions** to derive popularity and downvote status based on criteria.
- **HAVING clause** to filter out users based on the number of answered questions.
- **ORDER BY** and **LIMIT** to provide a ranked list of top contributors based on score. 

This query would be useful in performance benchmarking for identifying significant contributors within a question-and-answer system.
