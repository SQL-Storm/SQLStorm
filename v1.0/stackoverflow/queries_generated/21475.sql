This SQL query leverages various constructs including CTEs for better readability and organization of the logic. It computes user reputation categories, collects active posts within the last year, assesses comment statuses, and ranks the posts based on scores while considering associations through related links and bounties. The final output provides insights into the top posts segmented by reputation categories.
