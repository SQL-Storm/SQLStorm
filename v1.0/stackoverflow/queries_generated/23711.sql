In this elaborate SQL query, the following constructs are utilized to add complexity and depth for performance benchmarking:

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** are used to segment the SQL logic:
  - `RecursiveUserActivity`: To fetch user activity with ranking.
  - `AggregateVotes`: To aggregate votes per post.
  - `PostScores`: To calculate adjusted scores of questions.
  - `ClosedPosts`: To count how many times each question was closed.
  - `PopularTags`: To get the count of posts associated with each tag that has more than 10 posts.

- **Outer joins** are employed to ensure that we can gather all pertinent data from users, posts, votes, and closed post history, even if there are no related records in some tables.

- **Window functions** are included in `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank users based on their recent activity.

- **Correlated subqueries** are avoided but replaced with CTEs for clarity and separation of logic.

- **Complicated predicates** ensure that we are only getting desired results based on multiple filters, such as users with specific activity ranks and posts that have been closed.

- The **NULL logic** is managed using `COALESCE` to avoid issues with NULL values in aggregates.

- The **ORDER BY clause** sorts results based on multiple columns, ensuring a complex and ordered output.

This query sample is meant for heavy performance benchmarking when evaluating system behavior under a load of join operations, aggregations, and window functions.
