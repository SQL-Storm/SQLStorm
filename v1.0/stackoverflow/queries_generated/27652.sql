This SQL query aims to benchmark string processing by analyzing tags in questions, while also aggregating user engagement metrics. It identifies the most popular tags based on the number of associated questions and measures user engagement in terms of reputation, views, question counts, and comments. The final output displays the top enriched data correlating popular tags with their engaged users.
