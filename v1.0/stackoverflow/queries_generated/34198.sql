This query achieves the following:
1. Defines a recursive CTE (`UserHierarchy`) to create a simulated hierarchy of users based on their reputation.
2. Constructs the `TopUsers` CTE to find the users who have received bounties.
3. Aggregates relevant statistics about recent posts made by users in the `RecentPostStats` CTE.
4. Joins these CTEs together with the `Users` table, applying various filters and COALESCE functions for readability.
5. Orders the final result set by reputation and total posts, limiting the output to the top 10 users.
