This query performs a comprehensive analysis of users based on their activity, badges acquired, and the reasons for post closures. It uses multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the data, including recursive ranking for users, aggregation of stats, and join operations to collate various information points. The query incorporates outer joins, window functions, and calculations while handling potential NULL values, providing an intricate view suitable for performance benchmarking.
