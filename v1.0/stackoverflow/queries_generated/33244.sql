This SQL query performs an elaborate performance benchmark focusing on user contributions and the interaction of posts with their comments and votes. It uses recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to build a hierarchy of users with a reputation above a certain threshold and to join this data with posts, providing a summary of high-scoring posts alongside user information. The result is filtered for the top posts while leveraging outer joins to gather historical actions related to each post for benchmarking purposes.
