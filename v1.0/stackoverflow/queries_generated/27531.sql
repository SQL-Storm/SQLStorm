This SQL query generates a report of the 10 most viewed questions on Stack Overflow, including their title, body, creation date, view count, owner display name, answer count, and associated tags. It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first rank the posts based on the creation date and then filter the top 10 based on view count. The `STRING_AGG` function aggregates the tag names associated with each post into a comma-separated list. The use of joins to gather related data adds depth to the insights gathered from the schema.
