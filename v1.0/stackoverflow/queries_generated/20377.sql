This SQL query performs several tasks:

1. It creates common table expressions (CTEs) to rank posts by view count and filter top posts for each user.
2. It aggregates user data to include their reputation and badge counts.
3. It calculates tag statistics by counting the number of posts associated with each tag.
4. Finally, it selects the most popular posts, along with the associated user reputation and badge details, and information about tags related to these posts. 

This SQL uses various constructs such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `JOIN`, subqueries, and dynamic array handling with string manipulation functions to impressively gather and present benchmarking data related to posts, users, and tags.
