This query incorporates various SQL constructs including the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, correlated subqueries (in the form of `FILTER` clauses), intricate conditional logic, string aggregation, and has a set of filters demonstrating edge cases such as NULL handling and using aggregates for complex predicate calculations. It retrieves posts alongside their associated metadata, organizes them into categories based on activity, and applies conditions on aggregates to illustrate performance benchmarks within the given schema context.
