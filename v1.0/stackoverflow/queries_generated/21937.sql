### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  - `UserStatistics`: Aggregates user information, counts of upvotes and downvotes, and ranks users by reputation.
  - `RecentPostActivity`: Counts posts created by users within the last 30 days to measure recent activity.
  - `PostDetails`: Gathers post-specific data including comment counts and retrieves the most recent action taken on the post.

- **Overall Query**: Joins data from these CTEs, filtered for users with reputation greater than 1000, and allows a flexibility where only posts with higher views or comment counts are included. Posts are ordered by user reputation and post age, with a limitation to return the top 100 results.

- **Handling NULL Logic**: Used `COALESCE` to provide default fallback statements for potentially NULL values, ensuring the output remains user-friendly.

- **Bizarre Semantics**: The query uses window functions, correlated subqueries within CTEs, and combines multiple filters and rankings for performance benchmarking all within a singular structured query.
