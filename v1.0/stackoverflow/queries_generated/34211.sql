This SQL query performs the following tasks:
1. It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify questions and their corresponding answers.
2. It aggregates data to count the number of answers and group by relevant attributes.
3. It employs outer joins to incorporate information about the post authors and the closing reasons.
4. It applies window functions to rank answers based on creation date.
5. It includes complicated predicates and NULL logic, handling email statuses with `COALESCE` for users without an email.
6. It uses string manipulation to handle tags assumed to be stored in comma-separated format.
7. The final selection ensures that only questions with at least one answer and more than two tags are included, ordered by creation date and answer count.
