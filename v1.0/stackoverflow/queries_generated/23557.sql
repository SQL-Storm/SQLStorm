This SQL query performs the following:
1. It first creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedPosts`, which ranks posts made in the last 5 years based on their creation date while considering posts with a valid score or a view count greater than 100.
2. A second CTE named `PopularPosts` extracts data from `RankedPosts`, joining with the `Badges`, `PostLinks`, `LinkTypes`, and `Comments` to enrich the data with relevant information.
3. The final SELECT statement returns detailed information about each post, including user display name, scores, and counts related to badges and links.
4. It utilizes `CASE` statements to categorize results based on score and badge status while also utilizing `COALESCE` for handling nulls related to link types.
5. It filters posts based on the comment count and score before ordering the result by view count and score. Lastly, it limits the output to 100 records for performance benchmarking.
