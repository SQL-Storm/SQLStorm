This SQL query fetches a ranked list of users, their post titles, and comments while also retrieving information about closed posts along with their closing reasons. Further analysis is conducted to find frequently used tags and their post relationships with link types. It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs), correlated subqueries, window functions, outer joins, string manipulations, and various other SQL functionalities to provide a comprehensive performance benchmark.
