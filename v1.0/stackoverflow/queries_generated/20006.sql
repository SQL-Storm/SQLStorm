This SQL query involves several advanced concepts and uncommon SQL features, including:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive post history, active users, and question statistics.
- Window functions to rank historical edits of posts.
- Aggregate functions to get user votes and calculate average scores and view total for questions.
- Use of the `STRING_AGG` function to concatenate tags associated with questions.
- Case statements to classify view counts into different categories.
- Various outer joins to ensure that even posts with no edits or tag associations are included in the results.
