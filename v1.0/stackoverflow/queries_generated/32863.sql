This query showcases performance benchmarking through various SQL features:
- It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to traverse the post hierarchy, finding answers related to questions.
- It incorporates aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) and a window function (STRING_AGG) to compile data about users and their posts.
- It employs an outer join (LEFT JOIN) to ensure that all users are considered, even those without posts.
- Complex predicates are included to filter users and calculate statistics.
- String manipulation is performed to manage and aggregate tag names associated with posts.
