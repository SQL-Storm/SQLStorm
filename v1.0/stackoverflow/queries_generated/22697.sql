This SQL query generates a comprehensive report on users with a reputation over 100. It compiles user details alongside aggregated statistics of their posts—both questions and answers—voting tallies, badge achievements, and post history types. It utilizes CTEs for clean separation of logic and considers various aggregation methods alongside multi-condition logic, producing an intricate data set for benchmarking performance on complex queries. The use of `COALESCE` ensures that NULL values are handled effectively, thus optimizing the understanding of data trends across multiple facets.
