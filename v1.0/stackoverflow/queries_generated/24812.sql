##### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are used for organizing logic around ranked posts, filtering them based on specific criteria, summarizing user reputation data, and getting final results.
- **Row Numbering**: A ranking mechanism is introduced to only select the latest post per user.
- **Comment Counting**: A running total of comments is tracked for use in filtering criteria.
- **Dynamic Category**: Conditional logic categorizes posts by view count.
- **Aggregated User Data**: Another CTE aggregates user reputation, badge counts, and average bounty amounts from the votes for advanced insights.
- The **Final Results** CTE integrates the filtered posts with user data, ensuring only high-reputation users are included.
- **STRING_AGG** is employed to compile associated tags into a concatenated string format if a post has a linked wiki post.
- The final `SELECT` statement provides a clear structure and aggregates important metrics, ordered by significant engagement metrics (`Score` and `ViewCount`), limiting to the top performing results.
