This SQL query performs the following:

1. **CTE `RankedPosts`**: This aggregates posts of the last year, ranking them by score for each user and categorizing views into different categories.

2. **CTE `PopularPosts`**: This filters down to the top 5 posts for each user based on score while aggregating bounty amounts.

3. **CTE `BadgeSummary`**: It summarizes the badges earned by users.

4. **CTE `PostCommentDetail`**: This collects details about the comments on each post.

5. **Final Selection**: The main query combines results from `PopularPosts`, `BadgeSummary`, and `PostCommentDetail` and presents a comprehensive overview of popular posts, including user achievements and comment details.

The design considers various SQL features, including:
- Window functions for ranking
- Aggregation functions for summarizing data
- JOINS to combine information from multiple tables
- CASE statements to categorize and handle NULLs.

This query should serve well in a performance benchmarking setup, challenging systems with its complexity and size of the potential data being processed.
