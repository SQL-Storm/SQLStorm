In this SQL query, I've incorporated several constructs to showcase performance benchmarking:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** are utilized for organizing the query into logical sections, making it easier to read and maintain.
2. **Window Functions** are employed to rank posts by their creation date per user and sum votes per post.
3. **Outer Joins** are used to ensure all posts are included even if they have no comments or votes.
4. **Complicated Predicates** and **NULL Logic** are involved, with case statements that derive user activity status and comment status.
5. A subquery using `STRING_AGG` demonstrates the aggregation of strings for recent edits.
6. Additional calculations provide insights into user activity and post engagement. 

All these elements together create a comprehensive and interesting query that tests the SQL engine's performance effectively.
