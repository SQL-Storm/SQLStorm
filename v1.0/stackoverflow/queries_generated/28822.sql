This SQL query benchmarks string processing by examining the top-ranked posts based on tag popularity and their scores while leveraging string functions to parse the `Tags` column. It ranks tags based on the number of questions associated and retrieves the details of the top posts for those tags, highlighting the relationship between tags, posts, and user contributions.
