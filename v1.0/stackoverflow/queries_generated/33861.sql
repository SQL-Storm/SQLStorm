### Explanation:
1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The query starts with a recursive CTE called `RecursivePosts` that retrieves all questions and their corresponding answers, creating a hierarchy of posts with levels.

2. **Ranking of Posts**: The next CTE, `RankedPosts`, ranks answers to each question based on the score, allowing the selection of the highest-rated answer.

3. **User Statistics**: The `UserStatistics` CTE aggregates user data, calculating the number of badges, total bounty given, and counts of up and down votes for users.

4. **Final Selection**: The final query selects the question's details, comment counts, answer counts, and user statistics. It filters to ensure that only the highest-ranked answers for each question are considered, facilitating insights into popular posts and their engagement.

5. **Sorting and Limiting Results**: The results are ordered by the question date and limited to 100 entries for performance benchmarking. 

This elaborate SQL includes various advanced constructs for performance evaluation, involving multiple layers of aggregation and ranking to produce meaningful insights from a complex schema.
