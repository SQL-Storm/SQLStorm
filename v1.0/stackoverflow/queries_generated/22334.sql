This SQL query performs performance benchmarking by leveraging a series of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to rank posts, extract details about related posts, count comments, and categorize posts based on comment count and average bounty. It uses outer joins, subqueries, window functions, and conditional logic while ensuring that it checks for NULLs and delivers results ordered by various criteria.
