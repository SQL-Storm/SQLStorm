This query captures the performance benchmarking by joining multiple tables and using various SQL constructs such as CTEs, window functions, aggregated columns, conditional expressions, and string operations to output detailed information about users, their posts, and the history of edits to these posts. It accounts for a complex backdrop of conditions and outputs a ranked view of user activity related to posts of varying popularity.
