This query offers a comprehensive analysis that involves NOT just the ranking of users based on post count, but also filters for users with a certain reputation while joining tag popularity and recent activity on posts. The use of CTEs allows for modular query planning and better organization of the query structure. The final output presents relevant data holistically, combining user reputation, ranking, tags with high post counts, and recent posts.
