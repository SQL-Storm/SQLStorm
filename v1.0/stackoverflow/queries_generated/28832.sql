This SQL query benchmarks string processing through a couple of common operations: counting posts by tags (with conditions) and aggregating user badge information. It combines these facets to yield insights on the most successful tags in the last year correlated with the user who has the most badges, facilitating rich analytics suitable for performance measurement. The query takes advantage of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize complex aggregations in an efficient manner.
