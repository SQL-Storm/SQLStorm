This query generates a top 10 list of tags in terms of total views and post count, combining both post statistics and user reputation metrics to assess the influence and activity surrounding each tag. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enhances readability and allows for more complex aggregations to be computed prior to final selection.
