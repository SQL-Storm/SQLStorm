This SQL query benchmarks string processing by analyzing tags associated with questions in the "Posts" table, selecting the top 10 most used tags, and returning details about posts that are associated with these tags. It includes logic for handling the manipulation and aggregation of strings representing tags, as well as performance metrics like scores and view counts. The output will include the post ID, title, creation date, score, answer count, view count, associated tags, and other unused tags for comprehensive insights.
