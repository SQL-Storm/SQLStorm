This SQL query does the following:
1. It creates a recursive common table expression (CTE) to generate a hierarchy of posts to capture questions and their answers.
2. It aggregates user statistics, including the number of badges and total upvotes and downvotes received by users.
3. It computes post activity related statistics such as the number of upvotes, downvotes, comments, and edits for each post.
4. It combines the user stats and post activity to produce an overall report, showing the number of questions answered by each user along with their statistics.
5. Finally, it selects the necessary fields and orders the results based on the number of badges and total upvotes received by each user.
