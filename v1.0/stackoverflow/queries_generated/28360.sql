This SQL query benchmarks string processing by calculating and displaying data on active users (users with significant reputation and posts) related to the most popular tags from questions on Stack Overflow. The recursive common table expression (`RecursiveTagCounts`) processes the tags string to count the occurrences of each tag, then joins this data with user statistics to present a comprehensive overview.
