This elaborate SQL query benchmarks string processing by assessing the tags associated with questions on Stack Overflow. It calculates the number of posts, average view counts, and average answer counts for each tag, ultimately determining the top 10 most popular tags based on post frequency. The usage of string manipulation functions emphasizes efficiency in handling tag data.
