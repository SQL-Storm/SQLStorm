This SQL query retrieves the top 10 users based on reputation who have authored recent popular posts (within the last 30 days) that have received a considerable number of upvotes, showing their post title, view count, score, comment count, last edited date, and the types of history associated with their posts. Furthermore, it ensures the posts are linked to tags that have a minimum of 10 associated posts. The use of common table expressions (CTEs), recursive queries, outer joins, string operations, and window functions contributes to the complexity and performance benchmarking potential of this query.
