This SQL query demonstrates a comprehensive exploration of user activity on a Q&A platform, leveraging CTEs, complex predicates, case logic, window functions, and string aggregation while factoring in NULL logic and possible edge cases. The results provide a rich summary of users, their contributions, and associated posts while considering performance metrics for a benchmarking context.
