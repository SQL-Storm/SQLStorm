### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts created in the last year based on their score and view count using a window function (`RANK`). 
   - `ClosedPosts`: Counts the closures related to each post using the PostHistory table to derive recent closure data.
   - `UserPostInteraction`: Aggregates upvotes and downvotes for each user.

2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - The joins between `RankedPosts`, `ClosedPosts`, and `UserPostInteraction` are all outer joins to ensure that we include posts even if they donâ€™t have comments, closures, or user interactions.

3. **Complicated Predicates**:
   - The query includes complex filters combining conditions on the post title and score.

4. **Window Function**: 
   - Utilizes `RANK()` to provide hierarchical rankings within the posts grouped by their type.

5. **NULL Logic**: 
   - Uses `COALESCE` to handle cases where posts may not have been closed, returning zero instead.

6. **String Expression**: 
   - Incorporates the use of `UPPER` and `LIKE` to perform case-insensitive searches on post titles.

7. **Set Operators**: 
   - Utilizing conditions and joins effectively acts as a set operator in determining the dataset we want.

8. **Bizarre SQL Semantics**: 
   - The classification of posts into categories like 'Top Posts', 'Popular Posts', and 'Other Posts' based purely on rankings introduces an unusual semantic classification in the output. 

The query strategically employs the database schema while demonstrating varied SQL constructs to create a performant benchmarkable query.
