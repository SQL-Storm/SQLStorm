### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query utilizes multiple CTEs to organize data, each focused on a specific subset of information:
   - `RankedPosts` ranks posts by score and view count, filtering for posts created within the last year.
   - `TopRankedPosts` selects only the top-ranked posts.
   - `PostDetails` gathers relevant information about the posts, including the author's name and total bounty.

2. **Calculations and predicates**: 
   - It calculates comment count, total bounty from votes, and checks post status through cases on the `PostHistory` table.

3. **Outer Joins**: 
   - The use of `LEFT JOIN` allows for gathering records that might not have corresponding entries in the join table (Votes and PostHistory).

4. **String Concatenation**: 
   - The use of `CONCAT_WS` and `array_agg` constructs a comma-separated list of tags associated with the posts.

5. **Bizarre semantics and edge cases**: 
   - The query addresses postsâ€™ statuses based on derived table checks (e.g., checking for 'Closed' posts with a bounty), which adds complexity and edge condition handling.

6. **HAVING Clause**: 
   - Filters out posts based on aggregate conditions and NULL checks for robust results.

7. **Use of window functions**: 
   - Window functions apply ranking and counting without collapsing rows, maintaining the granularity of data in derived tables.

This query thus exemplifies a complex SQL operation suitable for performance benchmarking across various SQL features and constructs.
