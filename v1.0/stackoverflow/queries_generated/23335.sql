This elaborate SQL query combines several advanced constructs. 

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It includes multiple CTEs like `UserReputation`, `PostSummary`, `PostWithHistory`, and `RankedPosts` for modularity.
- **Aggregations**: It aggregates votes and comments for each post and uses conditional logic.
- **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER` function creates ranks based on the history date.
- **Outer Join**: It uses left joins to include posts without history or votes.
- **Complicated Predicates**: The final selection includes conditions on reputation and net votes.
- **Grouping and Having**: It groups results by user and post details with a `HAVING` clause on vote differences to filter out insignificant posts.
- **String and NULL Handling**: Multiple cases handling NULL values in reputation are used throughout.
- **Bizarre Semantics**: Customized ranking logic guards against cases where no votes are counted, ensuring only significant entries are returned.

This query demonstrates the complexity you can achieve while delivering analytics for user engagement and post activity over the StackOverflow schema.
