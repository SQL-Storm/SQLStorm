This SQL query performs an analysis of posts from the Stack Overflow schema, focusing on those that have been edited in the last year. It uses multiple CTEs to aggregate data, calculate counts, and manage complex conditions such as traffic categorization. Each post's reopenness and editing history are evaluated, providing a comprehensive overview that includes traffic classification and associated tags. The use of string aggregation and window functions adds additional depth to the analysis, while also addressing obscurity in the semantics of post edits and interactions.
