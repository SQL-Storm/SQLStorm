This SQL query executes several layers of complexity:

1. A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) named `UserReputationCTE` gathers users with high reputations, allowing up to three levels of reputation hierarchies.

2. A second CTE, `MostActiveUsers`, aggregates comment counts and views of users with a reputation greater than 500, providing insights into user activity.

3. The `TopPosts` CTE retrieves the titles and scores of posts created within the last year, ranking them by score.

4. The final selection combines these CTEs with further conditions, filtering users based on their accounts not being created in the last 30 days and requiring at least one defined location or website URL. 

5. It orders the results based on user reputation and total views, limiting the output to the top 10 users.

This query encapsulates a range of SQL elements such as outer joins, CTEs, window functions, and conditional expressions, and serves as a robust performance benchmark.
