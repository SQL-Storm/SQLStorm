### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE**: The recursive common table expression (CTE) generates a hierarchical representation of posts by recursively fetching answers for each question.
2. **Composite Aggregation**: The main SELECT aggregates various information, including the number of questions and answers, utilizing conditional aggregation for votes.
3. **Outer Joins**: LEFT JOINs are used to include users who may not have created any posts, ensuring users are included in the result set regardless of activity.
4. **String Aggregation**: STRING_AGG is employed to collect tags associated with each question.
5. **Filter and Sorting**: The query only includes users with a reputation of over 1000, sorted by the number of questions and upvotes, with pagination specified by OFFSET and FETCH for performance benchmarking.
