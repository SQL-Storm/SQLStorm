### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Three CTEs are defined:
   - `UserVoteSummary`: Calculates upvotes, downvotes, and the number of posts created by users with a reputation of 100 or more.
   - `PostWithBestDescription`: Ranks posts by their body length (description) for each user, providing either a description or a default message if the body is null.
   - `TagUsage`: Calculates the number of posts and average views for each tag.

2. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines user statistics and tag usage, allowing for cases where there are tags with zero usage or users without any posts.

3. **CASE Statements**: Determines the user status based on their activity and distinguishes between "Active User" and "Inactive User."

4. **WHERE Conditions**: Filters results based on user voting activity and tag post counts, showcasing intricate logical connections.

5. **ORDER BY with NULLS LAST**: Sorts the results by display name, ensuring that any NULL user values appear at the end.

6. **LIMIT**: Restricts the output to a maximum of 50 rows.
