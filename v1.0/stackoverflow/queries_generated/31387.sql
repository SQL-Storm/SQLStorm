This query does the following:
- It defines a recursive CTE (`RecursivePostHierarchy`) to build a hierarchy of posts and their relationships, especially focusing on parent-child relationships among posts.
- Another CTE (`PostStatistics`) aggregates statistics about each post, including votes, answer counts, and the level of the post in the hierarchy.
- The final selection from `RecentPosts` filters those posts created in the last 30 days, reflecting recent activity, and calculates an adjusted count for answers and comments â€” ensuring at least a value of 1 to avoid division by zero errors.
- It orders the result set based on the calculated vote ratio while ensuring only posts with upvotes are included.
- It limits the output to the top 10 posts with the highest vote ratios.
