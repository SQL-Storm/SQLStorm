### Explanation of the SQL Query Components
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: This CTE calculates various post-related metrics, including ranking posts per user and counting comments related to each post.
   - `PostHistoryWithDetails`: This aggregates the post history details, consolidating close reason notifications and closing user information.

2. **String Aggregation**:
   - The `GROUP_CONCAT` function is used to concatenate history types for more comprehensible outputs.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` and `DENSE_RANK()` assign ranks to posts, allowing for categorization based on user and recency.

4. **Conditional Logic**:
   - A `CASE` statement defines categories for posts based on their ranks.

5. **NULL Handling**:
   - Use of `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` ensures that division operations do not encounter divide-by-zero errors, providing fallback values.

6. **Joins**:
   - The query employs a left join between ranked posts and post history to incorporate additional details, ensuring no posts are omitted if they have no history.

7. **Filtering and Ordering**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters posts that have been viewed over 50 times or have a recorded close reason. The result is ordered by score and view-to-comment ratio.

This query is designed to benchmark performance by using a variety of SQL features, resulting in potentially complex and heavy computations suitable for analysis in a SQL database.
