This elaborate SQL query demonstrates various advanced techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to segment the problem into manageable pieces. The query ranks posts, aggregates user votes, incorporates close reasons, and uses conditional logic to classify questions while employing outer joins and NULL management strategies for enhanced performance results, thus catering to the requirement for performance benchmarking.
