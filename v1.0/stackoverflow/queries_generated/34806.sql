This elaborate SQL query consists of several components:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query utilizes multiple CTEs to create logical steps for ranking posts, summarizing statistics by user, and final selection based on posts made.
- **Window Functions**: It includes `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking posts per user and `COUNT() FILTER()` to calculate upvotes and downvotes.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: It summarizes statistics such as total posts, total upvotes, total downvotes, and average score by the owner's display name.
- **CASE Statements**: It categorizes users into expertise levels based on the number of posts.
- **LEFT JOIN**: It also includes a check for users who have not made any posts, ensuring that the results represent the completeness of users in the environment.

This query aims at providing insights into user performance and contributions, showcasing various SQL features effectively.
