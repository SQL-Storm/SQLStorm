This SQL query retrieves the top ten users with the most questions, while applying several advanced SQL constructs, including:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to gather questions and their related answers.
- Aggregation using `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to analyze user contributions based on questions asked, answers provided, upvotes, downvotes, and average views.
- String aggregation with `STRING_AGG` to collate tags associated with each user's questions.
- A filtering condition using a correlated subquery to ensure users have above-average reputation scores. 
- The `HAVING` clause limits results to users who have asked more than 5 questions.
- Finally, the results are ordered primarily by the number of questions and secondarily by upvotes received.
