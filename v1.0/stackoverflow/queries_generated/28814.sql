This query benchmarks string processing by extracting and counting tags within the specified timeframe, then retrieving relevant data about recent posts that contain those tags, capped to the top 5 recent posts per tag based on their creation dates. The use of `UNNEST`, `string_to_array`, and window functions demonstrates the string handling performance effectively.
