### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `UserScore`: Summarizes user upvotes and downvotes.
   - `PostRetention`: Aggregates post counts and retention metrics (average age of posts).
   - `PostHistoryAnalysis`: Analyzes post history, encapsulating edits and comments.

2. **LEFT JOINs** are used to aggregate information where entries might not exist, particularly in votes or post edits.

3. **COALESCE** and NULL handling ensure that counts and averages work even when no matching data is found.

4. **STRING_AGG** collects distinct edit comments to keep information compact and useful.

5. **WHERE clauses** impose conditions to filter users based on activity, ensuring that only those with substantial engagement are selected.

6. **Complex calculations** and conditional aggregations showcase nuanced handling of user engagement and post edits.

7. **Bizarre Semantics**: The query uses a unique approach of weighing view counts against upvotes, thereby introducing a perspective of post quality that may not be conventionally computed.

8. **Ordering** focuses on activity to potentially surface the most influential users based on post interactions and editing frequency.
