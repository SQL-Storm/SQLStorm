This query performs a variety of complex operations including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to rank posts, gather closed post statistics, and gather user statistics.
- Utilizes aggregates and window functions to determine the rank and statistics.
- Includes various joins, particularly outer joins, and applies filtering based on user reputation and post metrics.
- Uses COALESCE and CASE statements to handle NULL entries creatively, categorizing posts by closure status and tier.
- Orders results based on complex criteria, ensuring that the most relevant data is presented. 

The combination of these features creates an elaborate performance benchmarking SQL query while showcasing numerous SQL capabilities.
