This SQL query achieves several benchmarks in string processing:

- It calculates post statistics for each tag, including the number of posts, total scores, average view counts, and a list of contributors.
- It uses CTEs to gather badge counts for users, which are then related to user statistics.
- It finally selects relevant details, sorting by post count and score, thus allowing you to identify the most active and high-scoring tags along with their top contributors in terms of reputation and badges earned.
