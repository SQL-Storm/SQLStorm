This SQL query constructs a ranked list of posts based on their statistics, utilizing complex features such as CTEs, window functions, outer joins, and string aggregation. It counts comments and votes per post, assesses edit history, and categorizes posts based on their rankings and edit frequency. Additionally, it parses tags from post titles using string functions, integrating obscure SQL constructs to exhibit an advanced querying approach.
