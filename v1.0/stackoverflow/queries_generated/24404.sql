-- Notes:
-- This SQL retrieves information about the top 10 posts per post type created in the last year.
-- It also includes the userâ€™s reputation and classifies them into expert, intermediate, or beginner.
-- Additionally, it evaluates the tag status and score category for each post. Posts must have more than 5 comments or be associated with a bounty.
