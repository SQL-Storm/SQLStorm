In this SQL query, we create multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize our data and then use them to return a rich dataset that includes post hierarchies, user engagement, statistics on comments, votes, acceptance statuses, and closures. The `RecursivePostHierarchy` CTE recursively builds the tree of posts for nested relationships, while the `PostStatistics` CTE gathers statistics for each post. The final `UserEngagement` CTE provides user-related statistics. The main query produces comprehensive output about the top posts based on view count, along with related information about user engagement and post statuses.
