This SQL query extracts details about posts based on several complex criteria, utilizing multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and advanced SQL constructs such as window functions, outer joins, aggregates, and conditional logic involving NULL handling. The goal is to provide an elaborate performance benchmark by filtering posts in elegant ways while detailing why certain posts were closed or had a specific history of comments.
