This SQL query takes an elaborate approach by utilizing multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first rank posts based on their score, gather user voting summaries, analyze post history, and ultimately filter for top questions while obtaining additional context through outer joins. It also includes a ranking mechanism that differentiates between "Top 10 Posts" and "Other Posts". The use of `COALESCE` manages potential NULL values for parent posts. The query covers a range of SQL techniques and looks for performance benchmarking opportunities by processing various metrics in a structured manner.
