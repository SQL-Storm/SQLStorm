This query employs various SQL constructs: 

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: To break down the complexity into manageable components, including ranked posts, user badges, the latest post history edits, and details regarding closed posts.

2. **Window Functions**: To rank questions for each user based on their score.

3. **Outer Joins**: To include users without badges and users whose posts may not have been edited or closed.

4. **COALESCE**: To handle potential NULL values when aggregating badge counts.

5. **Recursion or filtering**: Not used directly here but can be adapted to include hierarchical or recursive relationships if necessary.

6. **Complicated predicates**: A variety of filtering criteria to ensure quality and relevancy.

7. **Ordering**: To ensure the output is sorted by reputation and score, giving insight into high-performing users.
