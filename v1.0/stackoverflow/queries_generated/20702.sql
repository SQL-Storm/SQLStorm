OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users) / 2;  -- Midpoint Pagination Logic

This elaborative SQL query performs the following:

1. **CTEs for Data Preparation**: It uses three CTEs: 
   - `RankedPosts` to rank questions by their creation date for each user.
   - `AggregatedUserData` to count actions performed by each user on their posts, capturing the number of close and reopen actions.
   - `PostTags` to aggregate tags associated with each post.

2. **Complex Joins**: The main query combines data using LEFT JOINs for optional data and INNER JOINs for mandatory relationships.

3. **String Aggregation**: It generates a concatenated string of tags associated with posts using `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Handling NULL Values**: It incorporates clever NULL handling using `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` to manage cases where there may be no close actions recorded.

5. **Midpoint Pagination**: The OFFSET is calculated as half the total count of Users, facilitating a midpoint pagination approach. 

6. **Ordering**: The results are ordered primarily by the number of actions and secondarily by the score of posts, maximizing the insight into highly active users with impactful questions. 

This SQL showcases advanced SQL functionality and thought-provoking constructs for performance benchmarking.
