This query generates a performance benchmarking scenario by leveraging:
- CTEs for modularity and clarity.
- Aggregation, including correlated subqueries for diverse metrics.
- Ranking functions to classify users.
- Case statements to create categories based on activity metrics.
- NULL logic to handle cases where no values exist due to outer joins. 
- Pagination to simulate real-world data retrieval and performance.
