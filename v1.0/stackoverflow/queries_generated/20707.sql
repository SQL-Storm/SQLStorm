### Explanation:
1. **CTEs Used**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by their creation date within each post type, calculates upvotes and downvotes, and counts comments.
   - `PostHistoryPrev`: Captures the first and last edit timestamps for each post.
   - `DetailBreakdown`: Joins ranked posts with their editing history while counting the number of times a post has been closed or linked as a duplicate.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - Used to rank posts based on their creation date.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**:
   - Used to count different types of interactions (close votes, duplicate links, and tags).

4. **Complicated Predicates**: 
   - The main query filters based on several conditions combining counts and ranks along with calculated boolean expressions.

5. **Aggregations**:
   - `STRING_AGG` is employed to list all associated tags in a user-friendly format.

6. **NULL Logic**: 
   - Uses `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values from join operations.

7. **Corner Cases**:
   - The `IsHotTopic` boolean checks if the title contains "SQL" or if the post has ten or more upvotes.

8. **Order of Results**: 
   - Ordered by creation date to show the most recent activity at the top.
