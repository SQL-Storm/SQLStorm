This SQL query showcases an intricate structure that utilizes CTEs to aggregate the count of badges per user, statistics for posts related to these users, and their overall activity. It performs joins along with filtering based on recent post activity, leveraging window functions to handle ranking, and applies complex conditional logic to assign user statuses. The result is further ordered based on badge count and view count, aligning with an elaborate benchmarking for performance.
