### Explanation:
1. **CTEs Usage**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts per user to find the latest posts from each user in the last year.
   - `UserEngagement`: Aggregates user engagement metrics, including counting posts and calculating the average bounty.
   - `RecentPostHistory`: Counts changes to posts in the last 30 days, capturing the number of edits or changes per post.

2. **Joins**:
   - The main query pulls data from the UserEngagement and RankedPosts CTEs with a left join to capture user metrics alongside their posts.

3. **Filtering**:
   - Only users with more than 5 posts and at least one bounty are included.

4. **ORDER BY and LIMIT**:
   - Results are ordered first by post count, then by post creation date, and then by the first change date, limited to 20 results for performance benchmarking.

This elaborate SQL query incorporates complex joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregates, making it suitable for performance benchmarking. 

This query aims to provide insights into users' engagement by cross-referencing their posts with their historical activity on the platform, all while considering various peculiarities of the schema.
