This query:

1. **CTEs**: Uses common table expressions to calculate user badges, post metrics including number of comments and answers, and aggregates user post statistics.
2. **String Aggregation**: Combines badge names into a single string for each user.
3. **Outer Joins**: Ensures that even users without badges or posts are included in the final results.
4. **Window Functions**: Calculates rank and averages within the post metrics.
5. **Complicated Predicates**: Filters based on user reputation and existence of either posts or badges.
6. **NULL Logic**: Uses COALESCE to handle NULL values for badges and post statistics elegantly.
7. **Sorting**: Orders results by score, total posts, and user display name, demonstrating multi-level sorting including `NULLS LAST`.

This SQL query is designed for performance benchmarking while also being rich in complexity and demonstrating a range of SQL features.
