### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (`RankedPosts`, `UserEngagement`, `UserWithMaxPosts`)**: The use of CTEs to break down the logic clearly and handle different parts of the query efficiently.
  
2. **Window Functions**: Implemented to rank posts per user (`ROW_NUMBER()`) and for user engagement metrics.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Utilized to find out bounty status compared to the average within the `SELECT` clause.

4. **LEFT JOIN & NULL Logic**: Accounts for users without posts or engagement allowing for NULL handling and a fallback 'No Closure' message.

5. **Complex Predicates**: Such as reputation-to-view ratios and the use of `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero.

6. **Aggregations with Grouping**: Counts and sums to get meaningful engagement metrics per user.

7. **Dynamic Conditions**: Used dynamic filtering based on certain calculated fields to bring only the top users based on their posts and engagement.

8. **Obscure Semantics**: Includes logic to classify users as average, above average, or below average based on a calculated mean across the entire UserEngagement CTE. 

This elaborate query gives insights into user engagement with a particular focus on their post history and activity while handling potential NULLs and ensuring the structure accommodates various conditions and joins aptly.
