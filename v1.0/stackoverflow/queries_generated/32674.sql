This SQL query is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of user performance in a Stack Overflow-like environment. It utilizes recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to gather user stats, aggregates post statistics, ranks users by reputation, and filters results based on badge count or post activity. The final output will list the top-performing users, emphasizing their badges, post activity, and reputation.
