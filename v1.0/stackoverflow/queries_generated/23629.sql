This SQL query showcases a variety of SQL techniques, including CTEs, outer joins, window functions, conditional cases, and complex filtering using a mix of performance benchmarking criteria. It retrieves the top-ranked posts based on their score while considering their closure status and facilitating nuanced interaction with the data through nested subqueries and aggregates. The main filtering criteria align posts with specific engagement metrics, enhancing performance insights effectively.
