### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Utilizes several CTEs to streamline data processing. `UserReputation` categorizes user reputation, `RecentActivePosts` gathers relevant posts from the last 30 days, and `PostDetails` collates comment counts and vote tallies.
- **Window Functions**: Implements `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify the most recent post per user.
- **NULL Logic**: Includes `COALESCE` to handle potential NULLs in vote counts.
- **Strings and Aggregations**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to create a concatenated list of tags while handling the intricacies of string substitutions.
- **Complicated Predicates**: Returns usersâ€™ posts based on a nuanced understanding of their engagement metrics (e.g., total votes gained).
- **Outer Joins**: Leverages LEFT JOINs to preserve user context even when comments/votes may not exist.
