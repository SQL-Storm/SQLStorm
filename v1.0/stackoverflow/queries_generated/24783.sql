This query provides an elaborate performance benchmark by combining several advanced constructs of SQL:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query includes multiple CTEs for user vote statistics, post activity, active users, and top posts.
2. **Aggregations:** It calculates total upvotes, total downvotes, and total bounties. Also counts comments and ranks posts.
3. **Window Functions:** It uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank posts within each user's contributions and `RANK()` for the top posts based on score.
4. **NULL Logic:** It uses `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values.
5. **Complex Filtering & Joins:** It filters users based on over a certain reputation threshold and selects specific posts for their activity.
6. **Predicates and Conditions:** The final WHERE clause checks for positive vote differentials and limits the result set to the top posts.

This query skillfully intertwines diverse SQL functionalities, testing both performance and complexity.
