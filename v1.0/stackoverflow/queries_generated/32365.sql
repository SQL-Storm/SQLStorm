This SQL query performs several advanced operations, including:

1. Recursive CTE (`PostHierarchy`) to create a hierarchy of questions and their respective answers.
2. A second CTE (`RankedPosts`) that computes a rank based on view counts per level of the hierarchy.
3. A CTE to count comments associated with each post (`PostComments`).
4. A final selection that returns only the top 5 posts per hierarchy level, including fields such as the title, view count, whether the post has an accepted answer, and associated tags.
5. String aggregation for the tags associated with each post. 

The combination of these constructs highlights deeper interactions between posts, users, and comments within the forum's ecosystem and is suitable for performance benchmarking due to its complexity and varied SQL features.
