This SQL query is designed to benchmark performance while encompassing a range of SQL features. It includes:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used for calculating user statistics, gathering top tags, and badge aggregation.
2. **LEFT JOINs**: To ensure all users are represented, even those without posts, votes, or badges.
3. **Aggregation and COALESCE**: For proper handling of NULLs and providing default values where necessary.
4. **Simulated String Matching with LIKE**: To count posts associated with each tag.
5. **Order and filtering with complex predicates**: To select users based on multiple conditions.
6. **STRING_AGG**: For aggregating badge names into a single string.
7. **NULL Handling**: Managing scenarios of non-existing relationships effectively with `NULL` precedence in sorting. 

This would help in assessing the database's capability to handle joins, aggregations, and CTEs efficiently.
