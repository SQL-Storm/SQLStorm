### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** are used to break down the query into manageable parts:
   - `UserBadges`: Computes total badges along with counts of gold, silver, and bronze badges for each user.
   - `PostStatistics`: Aggregates the data related to posts for each user, calculating total posts, question counts, answer counts, average score, and total views.
   - `ClosedPosts`: Counts the number of closed posts for each user based on their history.

2. **Outer Joins**: Various outer joins are utilized to connect users with their badges, posts, and the count of closed posts without losing records of users who might not satisfy all criteria.

3. **Complicated predicates and CASE expressions** are incorporated to classify users based on their activity, such as defining user habits in post closure.

4. **Window functions** are used to assign a rank based on the average score of posts, showcasing performance in a variety of ways.

5. **NULL logic**: The COALESCE function is used to handle potential NULLs gracefully, particularly where statistics about posts or closed posts might not exist.

6. The final query results in a ranked list of users for performance benchmarking, presenting rich analysis across user activity, badges, and engagement behaviors.
