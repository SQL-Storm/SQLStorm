-- Notes:
-- 1. The `LEFT JOIN` with `UserActivity` assumes some correlation of PostId to UserId which might not actually be correct; it's for demonstration purposes.
-- 2. Using `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank posts and filter the top results.
-- 3. `ClosedPosts` CTE filters and identifies reasons based on close history, cleverly implementing a nuanced Join.
-- 4. Keeping predicates for clarity while setting the stage for potentially bizarre logic as insights unfold based on actual data relations.
