This query showcases a performance benchmarking scenario that utilizes several advanced SQL constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It makes use of multiple CTEs for organizing the data, namely `RankedPosts`, `PopularUsers`, and `ClosedPostReasons`.

2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function ranks posts based on their scores within their respective post types.

3. **Aggregation**: `SUM()` and `COUNT()` functions are used to calculate the total bounties and the number of posts for users.

4. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` is used to gather closed post reasons.

5. **Outer Joins**: The use of `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all posts are retained in the final output, even if they lack matching records in related tables.

6. **Filtering and Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause in the CTEs and final query applies various criteria to narrow down results.

7. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by score and view count to provide a clear ranking of posts.

8. **NULL Handling**: The outer joins facilitate handling of potential `NULL` values gracefully.

This complex SQL query is suited for performance benchmarking against the specified Stack Overflow schema, integrating various advanced SQL features.
