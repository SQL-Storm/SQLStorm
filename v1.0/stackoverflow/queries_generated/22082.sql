This elaborate SQL query incorporates multiple advanced SQL concepts including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for organizing data:
  - `RankedPosts` to rank posts per user.
  - `UserStatistics` aggregates user data and badge information.
  
- Joins to connect related tables while filtering data based on conditions.

- Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking and `RANK()` for user ranking based on post counts.

- Conditional aggregation using the `FILTER` clause and `CASE` expressions.

- NULL handling with `COALESCE` for earning badge counts, ensuring no NULLs disrupt the totals.

- String aggregation for collecting distinct post types into a single field.

- Complicated predicates to determine active and inactive statuses, utilizing date comparisons.

- Overall structuring leads to insightful statistics about top users along with their latest contributions on a platform.
