This elaborate SQL query is designed to benchmark performance by combining various SQL constructs, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, conditional aggregates, LEFT JOINs, and complex predicates. It compiles user activity alongside historical post data while filtering based on various performance indicators, reflecting a complicated interaction between users and their posts over distinct periods.
