This SQL query employs several advanced constructs and techniques:
- A recursive common table expression (CTE) called `RecursivePosts` to fetch questions along with their answers, establishing a hierarchy.
- Aggregation in the `PostVoteSummary` CTE to summarize upvotes and downvotes for each post.
- The `PostHistorySummary` CTE captures critical events in the post's history, such as when they were closed and reopened, as well as how many times they have been edited.
- The main query combines these elements, applying filtering criteria based on view counts and timestamps, while utilizing window functions for ranking.
- Overall, it combines various SQL techniques including joins, aggregation, CTEs, and subqueries, creating a comprehensive performance benchmark query that is both complex and informative.
