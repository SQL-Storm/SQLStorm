This SQL query features several advanced constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, conditional aggregation, and NULL handling through COALESCE. Each component of the query serves to aggregate and analyze posts from the schema based on their popularity, voting trends, and tagging, demonstrating an intricate balancing of logic and SQLâ€™s capabilities while addressing potential corner cases like posts without tags or votes.
