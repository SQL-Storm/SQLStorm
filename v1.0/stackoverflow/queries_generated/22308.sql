This SQL query performs a complex series of operations to generate a ranking of users based on their badge counts and the total bounty amounts on their recent posts over the last 30 days. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enables legibility and step-wise aggregationâ€”first counting badges, then aggregating recent posts with their comments and bounties, and finally calculating overall performance statistics. The final query returns the top users while ensuring proper ranking is maintained. The `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` hint is used for performance benchmarking purposes, allowing the database engine to re-evaluate the plan for varied parameter inputs.
