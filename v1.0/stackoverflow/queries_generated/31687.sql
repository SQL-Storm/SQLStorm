This query retrieves a comprehensive report on users with over a threshold reputation, including their top question and the number of badges they have earned, while also tracking their post history and closed posts. It employs a variety of SQL features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions for ranking posts, conditional aggregation, and left joins to combine data from multiple tables for an enriched understanding of user contributions on Stack Overflow.
