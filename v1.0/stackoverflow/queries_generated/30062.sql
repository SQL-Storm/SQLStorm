In this SQL query:
- A recursive CTE is used to create a hierarchy of questions and their answers, which would allow for analyzing the relationships between various posts.
- The main query aggregates data around users and their activity on the platform, yielding insights into their question and answer contributions, badge counts, comments made, votes received, and related posts.
- Various constructs like `LEFT JOIN`, `COALESCE`, and `STRING_AGG` are employed to handle null values and combine data across multiple rows.
- A window function (`ROW_NUMBER()`) is used to rank users based on the number of questions they've asked, providing an additional layer of insight.
- The query also ensures the computation of relevant metrics while avoiding double counting by using DISTINCT and SUM with CASE statements.
