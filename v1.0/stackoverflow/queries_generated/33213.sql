This SQL query retrieves information about questions posted on the platform, along with their associated users, comments, votes, and tags, while utilizing a recursive common table expression (CTE) to establish a hierarchy of posts (if any). The result includes user reputation, question title, creation date, comment count, votes, and ranks based on user votes and answers. The query effectively aggregates and filters the necessary information for performance benchmarking while showcasing various SQL constructs.
