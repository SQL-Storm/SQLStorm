This query generates a comprehensive view of user activities by leveraging a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) to capture multi-level engagement levels. It retrieves users with more than 1000 reputation points and aggregates their posts, comments, and bounties while checking for the most recent post histories. Additionally, it combines users with lower reputations for a complete picture, applying outer joins, grouping, and complex logic to create a performance benchmark against varying user interactions and activity levels.
