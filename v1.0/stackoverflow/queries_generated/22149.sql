This complex SQL query encompasses numerous advanced constructs, including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular query organization.
- Window functions for ranking posts and determining user engagement.
- Multiple outer joins to derive engagement metrics for users.
- Conditional logic to interpret comment status.
- Specialized voting logic involving `VoteTypeId`.
- Structured filtering to focus on recent relevant data while ensuring performance.

This query can be further extended or modified to analyze different aspects of user engagement or post performance based on the requirements of a performance benchmarking scenario.
