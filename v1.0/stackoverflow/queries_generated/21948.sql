-- This query evaluates user activity and engagement around posts within the last month. 
-- It incorporates window functions to rank users and posts, aggregates votes, comments, and 
-- post views, while also handling variations in user engagement through correlated subqueries 
-- and lateral joins. Finally, results are filtered and ordered based on complex criteria.
