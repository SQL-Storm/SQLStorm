This query does the following:

1. **RankedPosts CTE**: Ranks posts by score for each user within the last year.
2. **UserInteraction CTE**: Gathers user details including comments made and total bounty received.
3. **PostHistoryDetails CTE**: Summarizes post history details for closed posts, including revisions and close reasons.
4. **ClosedPosts CTE**: Combines the posts with their history details specifically for closed posts.
5. **Main Query**: Joins user interactions to the closed posts to give a summary of users' closed post activities, categorized by close reasons.

Edge cases such as users without comments or bounties (hence NULL handling) and control over data representation (aggregating strings) are taken into account. Additionally, a subquery is used for pagination based on the number of eligible users.
