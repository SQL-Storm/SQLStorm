This SQL query leverages various advanced SQL constructs to create a performance benchmark. It calculates and ranks user reputations, aggregates comment and vote statistics for posts, distinguishes between closed and reopened posts, and evaluates user reputation comparisons. It includes CTEs for structured data retrieval and utilizes conditional logic to dynamically convey post statuses and user relations, ending with a final selection that ensures clarity on the posts selected.
