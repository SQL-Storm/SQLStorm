This elaborate SQL query leverages several constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and complex joins to achieve the desired data retrieval. It provides a comprehensive overview of the posts created in the last year, enriched with analytics such as comments, post history regarding closures, and user engagement related to bounties. The query also introduces a CASE statement for dynamic scoring categorization.
