This SQL query aggregates statistics for users, including their badge counts and post activity. It employs Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to accumulate user information from multiple related tables, ensuring that we consider cases where users may not have any posts or badges (using outer joins and COALESCE). It further ranks their most recent posts using a window function. The final selection filters users based on specific conditions, showcasing uniqueness in SQL semantics while providing intricate insights into user activity on the platform.
