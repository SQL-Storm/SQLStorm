### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **RankedPosts**: Ranks posts by score for each post type within the last year.
   - **PostTags**: Extracts tags from the post title, ensuring it deals with empty tags gracefully.
   - **TagCounts**: Counts occurrences of each tag across ranked posts.
   - **TopTags**: Ranks tags based on their frequency.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Selects relevant details from `RankedPosts` and combines them with top tags using a left join.
   - Uses correlated subqueries to count upvotes and downvotes for each post.
   - Applies conditional logic for determining post type.

3. **Fallback Logic**: Ensures null/empty tags are handled.

4. **Pagination/Limit**: Constrains the result set to the top 10 posts based on the overall score.

This query explores interconnected entities within a stack overflow-like schema and utilizes various SQL constructs to create a complex and functional output.
