This SQL query benchmarks string processing within the context of Stack Overflow's post data schema by engaging several intricate string operations. 

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **RankedPosts CTE**: Retrieves questions (PostTypeId = 1) and ranks them based on their score while filtering out non-positive scores.
2. **TopPosts CTE**: Pulls the top-ranked questions, limited to the top 10 for each reputation category.
3. **TagStats CTE**: Explodes the tags from the top posts into a separate table, counting how many times each tag appears.
4. The final `SELECT` statement joins the tags with the original posts to calculate how many questions contain similar tags, effectively measuring the prevalence of these tags across the dataset.

This query not only integrates complex logic for filtering, ranking, and string manipulation but also leads to interesting results that reflect on tags' popularity and distribution among questions.
