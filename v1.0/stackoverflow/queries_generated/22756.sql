This SQL query is an elaborate construct that includes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for user and post statistics, a variety of joins (including outer joins), conditional logic, and string expressions to extract meaningful insights from the Stack Overflow schema. The query also showcases performance benchmarks by using window functions, OFFSET, and FETCH for pagination, while incorporating a mix of aggregate functions.
