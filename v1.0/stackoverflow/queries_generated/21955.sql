This SQL query captures a complex scenario using various SQL constructs:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: `RankedPosts` and `RecentPostLinks` are used to create reusable datasets.
- **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM()` with `PARTITION BY`, and `MAX()` to calculate ranks and counts.
- **Outer Joins**: Used to include posts that may not have any related votes or comments.
- **Complicated CASE Statements**: To handle badge classification and comment status dynamically.
- **Predicates**: With logical OR and combinations of conditions to filter results based on computed values.
- **String Logic and NULL handling**: Using `COALESCE` and checking for NULLs to keep results comprehensive.
- **Date Logic**: Filtering posts created in the last 30 days and using intervals.
- **Set Operators**: Implicitly present through the combination of multiple filtering criteria.

This query provides a comprehensive benchmarking tool, showcasing both user engagement through comments and votes as well as linking behavior via post relationships.
