This SQL query combines several advanced constructs such as a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) that explores posts and their answers, aggregates counts using window functions, filters users based on certain conditions, and uses set operators to compare result sets. It also incorporates outer joins, correlated subqueries, and various conditional counts to accommodate performance benchmarking metrics.
