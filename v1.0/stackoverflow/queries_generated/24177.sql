This SQL query is constructed using various advanced SQL features including CTEs, window functions, conditional logic, and joins. It benchmarks the most recent posts within the last year, aggregating comment statistics and linking to user reputation, while also noting closed posts and their reasons. The use of `OFFSET` and `FETCH NEXT` provides pagination to the results, which can be important in performance testing for large datasets.
