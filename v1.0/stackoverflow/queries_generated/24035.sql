### Explanation:
1. **CTE `PostStats`**: Calculates various statistics for each post including comment count, upvotes, downvotes, last edit date, and assigns a rank based on the last edit date per user.

2. **CTE `FilteredPosts`**: Filters out posts based on specific criteria (having comments, more upvotes than downvotes, and being the most recently edited by the owner).

3. **CTE `RankedPosts`**: Segments the filtered posts into buckets (tiles) based on upvotes.

4. **Final SELECT**: Retrieves relevant data from `RankedPosts`, computes the voting status, and checks for the existence of a specific user's vote first, ensuring that selected posts have no typical voting action from "SpecialUser." 

5. **Sorting and Limiting**: Orders the results for readable insight on higher engagement, limiting the output to the top 10 posts for performance benchmarking.

This query showcases outer joins, CTEs, window functions, set logic, NULL handling, and various complex aggregates, making it an intriguing and multifunctional SQL construct for benchmarking in a real-world scenario.
