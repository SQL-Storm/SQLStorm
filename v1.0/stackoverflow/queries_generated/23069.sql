This SQL query showcases various advanced SQL techniques: 
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) aggregate user activity, post details, and user badges.
- Window functions rank users based on their reputation.
- Conditional logic formats the output for better readability.
- It uses left joins to ensure that it consolidates data even if some users or posts donâ€™t have corresponding records in linked tables.
- The final result displays a list of users, their reputations, post counts, and badge information with specific formatting applied to certain fields.
