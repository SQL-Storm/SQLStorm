This SQL query benchmarks string processing functionality by performing extensive aggregations and joins across the stackoverflow schema to determine the top contributors based on the number of comments, answers, and questions they have authored, along with their badge count. Various common table expressions (CTEs) help organize the logic, allowing for a clearer and more structured query.
