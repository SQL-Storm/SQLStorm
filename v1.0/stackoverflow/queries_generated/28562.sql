This query benchmarks string processing by aggregating statistical information about tags, including counts of related posts, total views and scores, and average user reputations. It retrieves the top 10 tags based on the number of posts created in the last year and provides details about the last user that edited the posts related to each tag. The query includes subqueries and a common table expression (CTE) for efficient computation and filtering based on dynamic criteria.
