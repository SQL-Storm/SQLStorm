This SQL query configures a comprehensive performance benchmarking metric aggregating user activity, badge statistics, post statistics, and the last activity date. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) facilitates modular data aggregation, while the CASE statement labels user activity levels by their total view counts. The STRING_AGG function retrieves associated tags for users with their posts, complicated by the NULL logic handling and dynamic aggregation from the potential absence of data. Depending on the SQL dialect, minor adjustments may be needed for functions and syntax.
