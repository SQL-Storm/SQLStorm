This SQL query is designed to benchmark user activity and prestige within a Stack Overflow-like environment by combining complex subqueries, window functions, and various aggregation techniques. Each stage processes and integrates user data, post statistics, and badge counts to ultimately identify qualified users who meet specific criteria while categorizing their activity status.
