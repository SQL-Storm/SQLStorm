**Explanation of Constructs:**
- **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: The query uses CTEs to build up different segments of data related to posts, including vote stats, closed post history, and comment counts.
- **Outer Joins**: LEFT JOINs are used to ensure that even posts without votes or comments are included in the results.
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER() and RANK() are used to create unique rankings based on different criteria.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: Subqueries could be included within the CTEs for more complex aggregations, though here they're utilized more broadly.
- **Complicated Predicates**: The final WHERE clause combines multiple logical conditions to filter the results for only relevant posts.
- **NULL Logic**: `COALESCE` is used to handle NULL values and ensure that if there are no votes or comments, these fields default to 0 or appropriate messages.
- **Set Operators**: Although set operators aren't explicitly included, variations could be added depending on the complexity desired.
- **Bizarre Semantics**: The `ClosedDate` handling reflects some SQL edge cases around date formatting and handling known 'not closed' values. 

This query serves for performance benchmarking by encompassing a rich variety of SQL features for testing execution speed and efficiency on a potentially large dataset.
