-- Edge Cases:
-- 1. Consider posts without comments or votes.
-- 2. Handle NULL values for AcceptedAnswerId and OwnerUserId.
-- 3. Leverage FILTER clause in vote counts for more granular control.
-- 4. Use COALESCE to provide default negative values for reputations.
-- 5. Ensure to consider "Accepted Answer" retrieval logic with ranking.
