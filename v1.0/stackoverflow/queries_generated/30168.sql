This query demonstrates various SQL constructs:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** are used for recursive user reputation calculations and average reputation calculation.
- **Window functions** are utilized in `RecentPosts` to rank posts by creation date per user.
- **Left joins** are employed to include user reputation and post history data, handling NULL values.
- **Correlated subqueries** are present in the `LEFT JOIN` to retrieve the most recent post history entry.
- **Case statements** facilitate conditional logic for displaying user reputation status.
- **Complicated predicates** analyze view performance against average reputation. 

This query effectively combines multiple SQL techniques for a comprehensive analysis of recent posts, user reputation, and post histories.
