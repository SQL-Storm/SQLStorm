This SQL query performs the following tasks for performance benchmarking:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: Ranks posts by score, tracks the number of comments, and counts up/down votes.
   - `ClosedPosts`: Retrieves detailed information on closed posts, including the closure reason.
   - `PostLinksCount`: Counts the number of links for each post.

2. **NULL Logic**: 
   - Utilizes `COALESCE` to handle potential NULLs from joins gracefully, ensuring no data loss and a sensible default ('Not Closed') for the closure reason.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - Incorporate `ROW_NUMBER()` and `SUM()` to provide ranking and vote counts within partitions.

4. **Engagement Score Calculation**:
   - Derived from the score and view count, normalized by the comment count plus one to avoid division by zero.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Filtering posts created within the last year and limiting the result set to the top 5 ranked posts per post type.

6. **Bizarre Tactics**:
   - The aggregation and filtering criteria designed to test the limits and performance of the SQL operation, ensuring that queries execute optimally against a potentially large data set.

This complexity will help in assessing performance under various data conditions while highlighting SQLâ€™s intricate capabilities.
