This SQL query illustrates a performance benchmark involving complex constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregate functions, outer joins, correlated subqueries, filtering contexts, window functions, and intricate groupings with conditional logic. The query retrieves user statistics based on their activity, badges earned, and interactions with posts, all while addressing NULL values in aggregate calculations appropriately. It also exhibits some obscure scenarios, like filtering based on complex reputational thresholds and recent post interactions combined with history data.
