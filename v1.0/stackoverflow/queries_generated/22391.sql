This query combines multiple SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for ranked posts, user activity statistics, and tag statistics. It includes complex predicates, NULL value logic, and makes use of window functions through `ROW_NUMBER()`, all while maintaining a focus on performance benchmarking across various dimensions such as post activity, user involvement, and tagging behavior.
