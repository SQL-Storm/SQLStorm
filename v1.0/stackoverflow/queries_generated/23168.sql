This SQL query incorporates several advanced SQL features including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, string aggregation, conditional expressions, and intricate filtering criteria to achieve an elaborate aggregation of post statistics and user achievements, while dealing with potential NULLs. It also provides a quirky output statement that summarizes the posts found.
