This SQL query combines several advanced techniques: 

1. **Recursive CTE** to fetch the hierarchy of posts (questions and answers).
2. **Aggregates** to count upvotes and downvotes for each post.
3. **Subqueries** with filtering to ensure the conditions are met, such as existing comments and score thresholds.
4. **Joins** across tables to gather badge information for the post owners.
5. **Pagination** to limit the results for performance benchmarking on user interaction with the questions, ensuring only interest-driven content is fetched.
