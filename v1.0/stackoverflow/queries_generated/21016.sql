This SQL query showcases various advanced SQL features and constructs including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to modularize the query.
- Window functions for ranking and partitioning.
- String aggregation with `STRING_AGG`.
- Correlated subqueries for specific aggregations.
- Complicated predicates and conditional expressions used in `CASE` statements.
- Handling `NULL` values effectively with `COALESCE`.
- Outer joins that combine various aspects of user activity.
