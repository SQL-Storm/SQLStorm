This query retrieves information about highly engaged posts from the last 30 days using CTEs for organization, introduces robust ranking and filtering logic, and covers multiple obscure SQL semantics like `COALESCE`, correlated subqueries, and window functions. It categorizes posts and user reputation effectively while addressing NULL cases and utilizing aggregate functions.
