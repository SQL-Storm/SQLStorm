This query accomplishes several objectives:
- It uses a recursive CTE (`UserPostStats`) to calculate user statistics related to posts they've authored.
- It aggregates statistics on popular tags from the `Tags` table.
- It joins to a badge summary via the `UserBadges` CTE.
- The final output includes user statistics like post count, total score, question count, and badge information, filtered by users who have authored more than 5 posts and have a score greater than 50.
- Additionally, it incorporates a coalescing strategy for nullable badge counts and names while sorting the final result set based on score and display name.
