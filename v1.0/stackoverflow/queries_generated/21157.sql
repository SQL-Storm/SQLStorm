This SQL query encompasses several advanced constructs:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: `UserMetrics`, `PostStatistics`, and `RankedPosts` calculate various metrics.
2. **Correlated Subqueries/WINDOW Functions**: Used to calculate average reputation and rank posts.
3. **Complex Aggregations and Filtering**: Filtered by conditions and used COALESCE to handle NULLs intelligently.
4. **Conditional Logic and Filtering**: The query includes advanced filtering with predicates in both the CTEs and the final SELECT statement.
5. **String Expressions & NULLs Handling**: Uses conditionals to define output labels based on ranking.
6. **Outer Joins**: Many outer joins are used to accommodate users with or without posts, votes, or badges.
7. **Set Operators**: Even though not explicitly used here, one could imagine using EXISTS or IN clauses for further filtering if needed.

This query effectively generates a detailed performance benchmark while also encapsulating complex SQL features and idioms.
