### Explanation of the SQL Query Components:

- **CTEs**: 
    - `RankedPosts`: Gathers posts with a count of comments, ranks them based on their score and compiles their tags into a string.
    - `FilteredPosts`: Filters the results of `RankedPosts` to include only the top-ranked posts that have comments and checks if they have an accepted answer.
    - `PostHistoryDetails`: Aggregates the post history to count close/reopen events and gets the last date of status change.

- **LATERAL and String Functions**: 
    - Used to process the `Tags` field, splitting the string appropriately and linking to the `Tags` table.

- **COALESCE with a Subquery**: 
    - Calculates the average score of posts created before the current post, adding a default value of 0 if no previous posts qualify.

- **Comments Logic**: 
    - The handling of `NULL` in the `AnswerStatus` utilizes a `CASE` statement to clarify the state of accepted answers.

- **Bizarre Semantical Edge Cases**: 
    - Included handling for posts with scores greater than the average score or with associated closing reasons, which may involve complex, intertwined conditions.

In this manner, the query integrates various SQL features and handles edge cases, providing a robust performance benchmarking platform in the context of the described tables.
