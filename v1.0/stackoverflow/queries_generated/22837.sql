This SQL query does the following:

1. **CTEs**: Creates multiple Common Table Expressions (`TagStats`, `ClosedPostStats`, and `RankedPostStats`) to calculate statistics about tags, closed posts, and their ranking based on their post count.
   
2. **Aggregations**: It counts the number of posts linked to each tag, the number of comments for those posts, and calculates the average reputation of users who created those posts.

3. **Closed Post Logic**: It includes logic to count how many times each post was closed and captures the first close date, highlighting those posts that contain closes.

4. **Window Functions**: Utilizes ROW_NUMBER window function to rank the tagged posts for each tag based on the post count.

5. **Filters and Conditional Logic**: The final SELECT statement includes conditions to filter for tags with the highest post count and evaluates their closing status, ensuring results are cleanly categorized.

6. **NULL Handling**: Leveraging COALESCE and filtering based on the presence of comments or close counts introduces NULL logic. 

This intricate query setup allows for rich performance benchmarking and evaluation of tags related to posts, comments, closures, and user reputations in the schema's context.
