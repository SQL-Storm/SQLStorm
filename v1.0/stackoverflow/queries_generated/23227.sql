This SQL query combines several interesting constructs: 
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are used to calculate user activity and derive post details.
- **Correlated subqueries** fetch the count of recent posts within the last year for each user.
- **Window functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()` are utilized to limit the posts fetched per user.
- Thereâ€™s a conditional case statement to classify expertise levels based on user reputation.
- **Outer joins** ensure users are included even if they have no posts.
- **NULL handling** with `COALESCE` and handling of reputation-related predicates increases robustness. 
- The `ARRAY_AGG` function collects distinct badge names into an array.
- The query integrates various filtering and aggregation techniques to yield insightful results in a single analysis run.
