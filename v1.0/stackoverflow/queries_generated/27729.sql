This SQL query performs a benchmarking analysis of string processing in a Stack Overflow-like schema. It identifies the most popular tags among questions and associates them with the top users based on reputation, effectively demonstrating the interconnectedness of topics and user engagement. The query involves multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and modularity, focusing on tag frequency, user reputation, and aggregating the results for a comprehensive summary.
