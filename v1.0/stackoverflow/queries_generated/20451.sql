This query utilizes several advanced SQL concepts including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), outer joins, aggregate functions, window functions, CASE statements, and complex filtering to benchmark user engagement on a Stack Overflow-like schema. It combines user activities, post engagements, and closure reasons, making it a good candidate for performance benchmarking in a relational database.
