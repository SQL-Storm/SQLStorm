This SQL query performs a performance benchmarking operation by implementing several advanced SQL constructs, aiming to extract an insightful summary of popular posts, active users, and post edit history. It includes common techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, aggregate functions, and joins to demonstrate a comprehensive data-driven analysis. It handles possible NULL values using `COALESCE` and utilizes string aggregation.

1. **RankedPosts CTE**: Ranks posts based on score in their respective types and tracks the total posts for each type created within the last year.
2. **ActiveUsers CTE**: Aggregates user data to show contributions over the last six months, including post creation and bounty amounts.
3. **PostHistorySummary CTE**: Summarizes post edit history for a quick reference of changes made to posts.
4. **Final SELECT**: Joins all CTEs and applies filtering and ordering to provide a detailed look at high-scoring posts, their owners, and a summary of modifications to those posts.

The query presents potential performance benefits when running against large datasets while also ensuring data integrity through the use of various constructs to report comprehensive statistics.
