### Explanation of Constructs:
- **CTEs**: Several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used to organize the query into logical components, such as ranked posts, posts with comments, and summarized post history.
- **Window Functions**: Ranking of posts by score is done using the `RANK()` window function.
- **Outer Joins**: LEFT JOINs are used to include posts that may not have corresponding comments or histories.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: Used to obtain the count of comments per post.
- **NULL Logic**: COALESCE is applied to handle comments that might not exist.
- **Complicated Expressions**: The CASE statements categorize user reputation dynamically.
- **Set Operators**: Though not explicitly requested, the structure allows for potential UNIONs for extended queries.
- **String Expressions**: Descriptive strings are generated based on existing data for clarity. 
- **Complex Predicates**: Multiple conditions are used in the WHERE clause to filter results effectively.

The SQL query aims to find high-scoring posts with relevant metadata, aligning with various database interactions.
