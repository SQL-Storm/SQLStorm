This SQL query performs the following complex operations:

1. It begins by creating a CTE called `RankedPosts` that gathers posts created in the last year, calculates the number of upvotes and downvotes for each post, and counts comments associated with each post.
2. It then adds logic to count how many times each post has been closed or reopened.
3. A second CTE `PostStatistics` aggregates post statistics by user, including total posts, total upvotes, total downvotes, and average close/reopen counts.
4. Finally, it selects user details and their respective statistics while applying certain predicates and calculated fields to classify users based on their activity and contribution levels.
5. The query applies ordering with special handling for NULL values to adjust the interpretation of the output concerning user contributions.

This complex structure illustrates various SQL constructs such as CTEs, nested aggregation, outer joins, and conditional expressionsâ€”all designed for performance benchmarking and deeper insights into user activity.
