This SQL query generates a performance benchmark by doing the following:

1. **RankedPosts CTE**: It selects posts created in the last year and ranks them based on their creation date for different post types.
  
2. **ClosedPosts CTE**: It aggregates closed posts to count their closure instances and fetches distinct reasons.

3. **PostStatistics CTE**: It compiles the ranked posts with their closure statistics, adding a status indicator of whether they are closed or open.

4. **UserBadges CTE**: It summarizes the badge counts and names associated with each user.

5. **FinalReport CTE**: It combines post statistics with user badge information.

6. **Final SELECT**: It selects all fields from the report while filtering for posts with a score greater than 5 and orders the result by score and closure count.

The complex constructs include outer joins, aggregated fields, correlated subqueries, string aggregation, and window functions, culminating in a powerful benchmarking query for the Stack Overflow schema.
