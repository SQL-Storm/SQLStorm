### Explanation:
- The SQL query uses CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to break down tasks into manageable parts:
    - **RankedPosts**: Retrieves posts with ranking for users based on the most recent and counts upvotes and downvotes.
    - **HighScoringPosts**: Filters for high-scoring posts where each user has only their top post in consideration.
    - **PostComments**: Aggregates comments for each post into a single string and counts them.
    - **ClosedPostReasons**: Retrieves any closure or reopening reasons for each post, using maximum to handle multiple potential records.

- The main selection pulls together the high scoring posts along with their comments and closure reasons, applying certain filters (e.g., views, closure status) before yielding a subset of top entries. 

- Logical constructs such as COALESCE are included to handle NULLs and enforce conditions based on views and reasons for closure/reopening. 

- This query could serve as a performance benchmark opportunity given its complexity and use of various SQL features.
