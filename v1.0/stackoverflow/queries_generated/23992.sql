This SQL query incorporates several complex constructs, including:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize data related to posts, close reasons, user reputation, and badges.
- Window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()`.
- Aggregation functions like `ARRAY_AGG()` for collecting data related to close reasons.
- A mix of outer joins and COALESCE for handling NULL values.
- A section that demonstrates how to check conditions dynamically using `CASE`.
- The use of correlated subqueries for obtaining a count of related posts.
- The final output displays various metrics and ranks, allowing for an interesting analysis of posts based on specified criteria.
