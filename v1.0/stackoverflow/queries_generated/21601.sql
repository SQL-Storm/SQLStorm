In this complex SQL query, I have implemented several advanced SQL features, including:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Two are used, one for aggregating recent posts and another for ranking based on vote difference and comment count.
2. **JOINs**: Multiple LEFT JOINs to associate votes, comments, and post links with the original posts.
3. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` function is employed to rank posts based on their calculated scores.
4. **COALESCE and NULL Logic**: Handling of NULL values gracefully, especially in vote counts and rankings.
5. **Complicated Expressions**: Rank expression encompasses both upvotes and downvotes for a net score, combined with comment counts for secondary sorting.
6. **Subquery**: Counts the number of gold badges held by the post owner and includes it in the output.
7. **String Expressions and Ordering by Including NULL Logic**: To ensure ranking reflects posts with and without votes, with ordering specifications to handle NULL values (e.g., `NULLS LAST`). 

This query tasks the database with considerable operations, while also demonstrating intricate SQL semantics that would be interesting for performance benchmarking.
