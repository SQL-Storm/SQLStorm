This elaborate SQL query performs a number of operations and illustrates multiple features such as:

1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize data based on user activity, post metrics, closed posts, and active users.
2. Window functions to rank users based on their activity and posts based on their score.
3. Outer joins to retrieve associated data that may or may not exist, offering flexibility in the results.
4. Conditional aggregation and CASE statements to classify posts and detect corner cases like the absence of closures.
5. Filters specifically tailored to maintain a focus on active and high-reputation users, ensuring the query's results are relevant and insightful. 

The structure allows for performance benchmarking by processing potentially large datasets with nested selections, ensuring thorough data analysis and complex relationships are addressed.
