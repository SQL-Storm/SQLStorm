This query structure uses a combination of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first gather user reputation and post statistics, then it ranks posts made by users, and finally generates a report of the most engaged posts while handling potential NULL values and outer joins. The complexity arises from the aggregation, window functions, and the relationships among different entities in the schema. The outer join at the end ensures we also capture users who have not made any posts to highlight their basic user information.
