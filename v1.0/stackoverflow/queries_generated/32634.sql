This query performs multiple complex operations:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Three are defined to aggregate data regarding recent posts, user statistics, and popular tags.
2. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` ranks the posts for each user based on their creation date.
3. **NULL Logic**: `COALESCE` handles potential `NULL` values in `ViewCount` and `Score`.
4. **LEFT JOINs**: Used extensively to include users even if they have no posts or tags.
5. **String Manipulation**: `unnest(string_to_array())` extracts and counts individual tags from the `Tags` column.
6. **Complicated Predicates**: Various calculations and aggregations are included to filter and rank the results.
7. **Subqueries and Grouping**: Used to compile and filter user and post stats before the final selection. 

The result provides insight into the most active users and their contributions, along with their latest posts and popular tags they may be associated with.
