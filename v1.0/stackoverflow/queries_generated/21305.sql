-- Note: This query performs various metrics summations and joins including:
-- - CTEs for organizing user votes and post summaries.
-- - Calculations of net votes and recent posts.
-- - Filters for user location and reputation.
-- - Use of COALESCE to handle NULL values.
-- - Complex CASE statements for classification.
