### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedPosts`: This CTE ranks posts based on their score within their post type and also aggregates tags associated with each post, filtering to include only posts from the past year.
   - `ClosedPostHistory`: This CTE extracts relevant history records where posts were closed or reopened.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank posts by score.

3. **String Aggregation**:
   - `STRING_AGG` is used to concatenate tags associated with each post.

4. **Outer Joins**:
   - The main SELECT uses a LEFT JOIN to also pull in any closure or reopening events from the `ClosedPostHistory` CTE.

5. **NULL Logic**:
   - `COALESCE` is employed to handle any potential NULL values gracefully, ensuring defaults are provided where necessary.

6. **Complex Predicates/Expressions**:
   - The CASE statement dynamically determines the closure status based on the type of post history event.

This query allows performance benchmarking by assessing how well it executes across various complexities like joins, aggregations, and conditions.
