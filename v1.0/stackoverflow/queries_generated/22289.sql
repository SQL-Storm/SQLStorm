### Explanation of SQL Constructs:

1. **CTEs (`WITH` clause)**:
   - `RecentPosts` selects posts created in the last year, with a row number assigned per user.
   - `UserReputation` computes total reputation and badge count for each user.
   - `TopPostStats` joins recent posts with user reputation to filter for high-scoring posts.

2. **OUTER JOIN**: 
   - Used to get badge counts even if there are no associated badges with users.
   
3. **Window Function**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique sequence to posts for each user.

4. **Aggregations**:
   - Counting duplicates, summing required tags, and maximum reputation within the query.

5. **Complicated Expressions**:
   - Using `STRING_AGG` to compile user names of those with top posts, and using `COALESCE` to handle NULL values gracefully.

6. **HAVING with complex predicates**:
   - Filtered results based on grouping, allowing analysis of relationships like duplicates and post quality.

7. **Bizarre SQL Semantics**:
   - The use of `STRING_AGG` across aggregated counts which are then filtered in the final result set creates a unique aggregation perspective.

8. **Ordering and Limiting**:
   - Results are sorted by total duplicate count and reputation, showcasing potentially popular subjects effectively while limiting the output for performance benchmarking.

This elaborate SQL query is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between users, posts, and tags, allowing for advanced performance tuning and analysis within the schema context.
