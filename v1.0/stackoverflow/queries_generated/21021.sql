-- Considerations:
-- 1. This query uses CTEs for summarizing user data.
-- 2. It employs COALESCE to handle potential NULL values in various SUM calculations.
-- 3. The use of STRING_AGG demonstrates how tags associated with posts can be collected into a single string format.
-- 4. All NULL checking is done gracefully to handle potential data issues.
-- 5. Correlated subqueries to gather averages based on the differences in timestamps emphasise temporal data consistency.
-- 6. Incorporation of window functions enables ranking based on total currency of bounties and responses.
-- 7. The HAVING clause ensures we only consider users with more than a threshold of post history.
