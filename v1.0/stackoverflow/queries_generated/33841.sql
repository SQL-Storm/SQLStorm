This query performs several operations:
1. The base data is narrowed down to posts from the last year, specifically questions.
2. It counts comments and distinguishes between upvotes and downvotes using conditional aggregation.
3. The interaction level categorizes posts based on comment count.
4. A secondary CTE aggregates badge counts for users.
5. Finally, the results merge both analytics and badge data, along with ranking the posts based on net votes and comments. 

The final output yields a comprehensive list of popular posts alongside the usersâ€™ badge achievements, offering insights into user engagement and performance.
