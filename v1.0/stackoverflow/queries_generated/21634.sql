### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Two CTEs are used to filter posts and rank users based on reputation.
   - `FilteredPosts` captures relevant posts created in the last year with a positive score, along with their comment count and vote tallies, while also ranking posts per user.
   - `TopUsers` ranks users by reputation to fetch the top contributors.
  
2. **Main Query**: It fetches relevant metrics for posts that belong to top users. It categorizes each post's vote trend and assigns labels based on rank.

3. **LEFT JOIN and COALESCE**: Combining `Posts` to fetch the last editor and managing NULL cases by substituting 'Unknown' for posts without available last editor.

4. **Dynamic Calculations**: Incorporates calculated expressions for user and post categorization, presenting contributions in a summarized and analytic fashion.

Overall, this query demonstrates various SQL constructs while adhering to the database schema, generating a comprehensive view of the top contributors and their recent activity within specified constraints.
