This query leverages recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to build a hierarchy of tags associated with questions, performs aggregations on users and their posts, and includes various features such as outer joins, string aggregation, and calculations. A performance benchmarking section is also included to track execution time, which is crucial for evaluating the query's efficiency in a real-world scenario.
