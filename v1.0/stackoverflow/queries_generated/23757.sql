-- This query retrieves the top-ranked posts created in the last year, 
-- detailing their edit history, vote counts, and classifies them based on rating. 
-- It includes complex calculations for vote counting, 
-- leverages window functions, outer joins, and aggregates, 
-- while carefully handling potential NULL values and edge cases.
