This SQL query:
- Constructs several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to gather data on users, their badges, and post activity.
- Calculates total badges of different classes and counts the posts they've made, as well as their bounty amounts.
- Ranks users based on their engagement metrics using a complex formula involving weights for different types of badges.
- Categorizes the users based on their engagement and contributions, accounting for users with no engagement or contributions.
- Includes conditions for outer joins, window functions for ranking, and COALESCE for handling NULL values, showcasing a variety of SQL capabilities to create a robust performance benchmark query.
