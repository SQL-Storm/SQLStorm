In this elaborate SQL query, several constructs are used for performance benchmarking:

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** are utilized to encapsulate complex subqueries: `RankedPosts`, `RecentBadges`, and `PostHistoryAggregates`.
- **Window Functions** (specifically `RANK()`) are applied to rank posts according to their score for each post type.
- **LEFT JOINS** are used to ensure that even if there are no matching entries, the posts will still appear in the results.
- **GROUP BY** and aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `STRING_AGG()`, `ARRAY_AGG()`) are used for summarizing data across multiple posts or badges.
- **Complicated predicates/expressions** are present in the main `SELECT` query, using `COALESCE` to handle NULLs for badge counts and names, and including filters when counting certain post history types.
- **STRING Manipulations** via `STRING_AGG()` are applied to collate badge names into a single string.
- **Bizarre Semantics** include the use of a `FILTER` to aggregate counts based on specific history types, showcasing SQLâ€™s ability to filter aggregation conditions. 

This query ultimately provides insights into top-ranked posts, their authors, associated badges, and their history while handling numerous corner cases and NULL logic effectively.
