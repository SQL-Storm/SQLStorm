This SQL query combines:

- A recursive CTE (`RecursivePostHierarchy`) to create a hierarchy of posts, allowing you to track questions and their related answers.
- Aggregated user statistics, including total posts, counts of questions and answers, total scores, associated tags, total upvotes, and downvotes, along with the latest post date, providing interesting insights into user engagement.
- An additional segment to benchmark post edits using JSON aggregation on edit comments and a window function to rank edits per user. 

This intricate design allows for comprehensive performance benchmarking across users and their posts while exploring complex relationships between different entities in the schema.
