This elaborate SQL query does the following: 

1. It constructs a recursive common table expression (CTE) to create a hierarchy of posts and answers, starting from questions.
2. It computes user reputation metrics and ranks the users based on their reputation.
3. It aggregates details of posts, such as the count of comments, total views, scores, and tags, while filtering to only include posts created in the last year.
4. It identifies the top users who have authored posts, based on total score and number of posts.
5. It then selects the top posts along with their respective owner details and joins with top users using an outer apply, ensuring that it captures posts from highly ranked users while also filtering out the top posts based on score and view count. 
6. The final result is ordered by the postsâ€™ scores and view counts for performance benchmarking purposes.
