This elaborate SQL query performs various operations:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are used to rank posts, identify closed posts, and get popular tags.
2. **Outer joins** are employed to link post data with the reasons why they might be closed.
3. The **window function** is used to rank posts and closed posts, focusing on the most recent activity.
4. The query includes **complicated predicates** to filter based on user reputation, score, and close reason logic.
5. It employs **NULL logic** to ensure both existing and non-existent reputations are accounted for.
6. The use of **string functions** (`string_to_array`, `unnest`) helps extract and count popular tags associated with posts.
7. An **EXISTS** clause checks for votes by users that might be a special case (for example, users who might have been deleted).
8. The final output is ordered by post score and creation date. 

This query is well-rounded in showcasing various SQL constructs while addressing potential edge cases with unique predicates and content filtering.
