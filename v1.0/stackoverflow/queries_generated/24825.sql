### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `UserPostMetrics`: Determines each userâ€™s post metrics including total posts, total questions/answers, total score, average views, and the date of their last post.
   - `ClosedQuestionCounts`: Counts the number of questions that were closed by each user based on certain post history types.
   - `UserReputationIncrease`: Computes a reputation bonus based on badges and post history of users.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Selects user metrics, including their closed question count and reputation bonus.
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank users based on their total scores in descending order.

3. **Joins**: 
   - **LEFT JOIN** is used with CTEs to ensure that even users with zero posts or closed questions appear in the final output.

4. **Predicates**:
   - The final output filters out users with no posts and ensures that the average views are not NULL.

5. **Handling NULLs**: 
   - `COALESCE` is utilized to default any NULL values in closed question counts and reputation bonuses to zero, ensuring cleaner outputs.

This query effectively aggregates and ranks user activity based on their posts and actions on the platform, reflecting a comprehensive structure suitable for performance benchmarking.
