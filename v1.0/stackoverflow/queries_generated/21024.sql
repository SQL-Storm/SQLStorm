### Explanation of Constructs Used:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `UserBadges`: Aggregate information about users and their badges.
   - `RecentPosts`: Retrieve posts created in the last 30 days per user, ranking them by creation date.
   - `TopTags`: Identify tags with a substantial number of votes and associated posts.
   - `PostHistoryDetails`: Track the history of posts (e.g., close and reopen events) from the last 90 days.

2. **Correlated Subqueries**: Used to filter and count distinct events in the `PostHistory` data.

3. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank recent posts by user to fetch the most recent post.

4. **Outer Joins**: Multiple `LEFT JOIN`s ensure that we retain users even if they have no recent posts or tags.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The use of conditions such as reputation and vote counts serve to filter on semi-complex criteria.

6. **NULL Logic**: `COALESCE` is utilized to handle NULL values, ensuring counts return zero instead of NULL where applicable.

7. **Aggregations and Grouping**: Comprehensive use of aggregation functions to summarize data based on various criteria.

8. **Unusual Semantics**: The combination of multiple metrics and cross-referencing them to find unique patterns provides interesting insights into users' activities and post histories.
