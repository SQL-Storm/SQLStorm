This SQL query retrieves detailed information about posts created in the last year, including their authors, scores, and comment counts. It also aggregates badge counts and up/down votes from users, incorporating complicated ranking and filtering logic. It uses common table expressions (CTEs) for structured data processing, involves outer joins, and includes a nuanced approach to handle potential NULL values, providing a multifaceted view of the posts and their authors' activities.
