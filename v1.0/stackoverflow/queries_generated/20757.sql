This SQL query is constructed with multiple components that utilize CTEs, LEFT JOINs, STRING_AGG for aggregating strings, conditional logic in CASE statements, and a UNION to introduce uncommon characteristics, such as users with no activity. Itâ€™s designed for performance benchmarking to analyze user engagement and benefits (badges) in relation to their post metrics on the platform, while being mindful of SQL semantics that handle NULL values and aggregation intricacies.
