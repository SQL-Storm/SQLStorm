### Explanation
- **CTEs**: Several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used:
    - `PostStats` computes various statistics of posts created after 2022.
    - `ActiveUsers` identifies users who were active within the last 30 days and ranks them by reputation.
    - `PostTypesCount` counts the posts by type.
    - `TopCloseReasons` retrieves the most recent close reasons for posts.
  
- **LEFT JOINs**: Different pieces of information from the CTEs are combined, allowing for comprehensive data while preserving all entries from the `PostStats` CTE.

- **COALESCE and NULLIF**: Used to provide a default value if the body of a post is empty.

- **Sorting and Paging**: Results are ordered by score and view count, and pagination is implemented to fetch a specific data range.

- **Complex Filters**: The WHERE clause includes multiple conditions combined with logical operators to filter posts based on view count and engagement metrics.

- **Obscure SQL semantics**: The query reflects how one can deal with potentially NULL values in a way that respects SQLâ€™s handling of non-standard semantics while ensuring the useful content is highlighted.
