This SQL query is carefully crafted to benchmark complex queries involving multiple advanced SQL concepts. Here's a breakdown of its features:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RecursiveFilmography`: Fetches the top five recent movies for each actor along with their production years.
   - `RecentMovies`: Filters down the results to only include the most recent five movies for each actor.
   - `ActorsWithKeywords`: Gathers keywords associated with movies in which the actors participated.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is used in the CTE to assign a ranking based on the production year of movies for each actor.

3. **Aggregations with String Expressions**:
   - `STRING_AGG()` is used to concatenate the titles of movies.

4. **NULL Handling**:
   - `MIN(NULLIF(ra.production_year, 0))` avoids returning zero years by turning them into NULLs.

5. **Complicated Predicates and Expressions**:
   - The query includes diverse conditions in the `HAVING` clause, ensuring that only actors with more than two distinct titles are included.

6. **Outer Joins and Set Manipulation**:
   - `LEFT JOIN` retrieves actors without keywords as well, making it robust against actors who might not have any associated keywords.

7. **Unusual Semantics**:
   - The use of `CASE` statements for calculating a post-2000 ratio showcases non-standard conditional logic in aggregation, which can bring attention to actors' career evolution.

To summarize, this SQL query exemplifies competencies in joining, aggregating, and filtering in a performance-benchmarking scenario within a movie database context.
