This SQL query incorporates various advanced SQL constructs:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: 
   - `movie_hierarchy` uses recursion to build a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, limited to a depth of 3.
   - `actor_movie_counts` counts the number of movies each actor has participated in.
   - `top_actors` identifies actors with more than 5 movie credits.
   - `movie_keywords` aggregates keywords associated with each movie.

2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - A left join is used to include movies even if they don't have additional info available.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: 
   - A subquery to filter top actors based on names in the representation of movies.

4. **Array Aggregation**: 
   - `array_agg` is used to gather keywords for each movie.

5. **Coalesce**: 
   - It provides a fallback value for movies without additional information.

6. **Complicated predicates and calculations**: 
   - The use of conditions and filtering ensure that only movies from a certain year and match a specific level of the hierarchy are included.

7. **Ordering and result shape**: 
   - The overall results are ordered by movie title and actor name for organized output. 

This query can serve as a performance benchmark across different database systems, testing the optimization capabilities of various SQL engines for complex queries.
