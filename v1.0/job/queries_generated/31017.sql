This SQL query incorporates various advanced SQL constructs such as:

1. **Recursive CTE**: To create a hierarchy of movies, distinguishing between episodes and their respective parent series.
2. **Aggregations**: Counting distinct actors and aggregating their names.
3. **Outer Joins**: To ensure all movies are included regardless of whether they have associated actors or keywords.
4. **String aggregation**: Combining actor names and keywords into a single string for readability.
5. **Complicated predicates**: Filtering for movies produced after 2000 with a non-zero actor count.
6. **Group By with Having**: To ensure only movies with more than two associated keywords are included.
7. **Ordering**: Sorting results primarily by production year and actor count for easy analysis. 

This creates a rich dataset useful for performance benchmarking of SQL queries in a complex relational schema.
