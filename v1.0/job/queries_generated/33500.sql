This SQL query performs an elaborate analysis on movies from the `aka_title` table, calculating various metrics and relationships about the movies, their keywords, and their cast. It implements recursive CTEs to build a movie hierarchy, aggregates keywords, and counts actors associated with the movies, while also calculating a "role filling ratio." The results are filtered for movies produced from the year 2000 onwards and are ordered by the calculated role filling ratio and production year.
