### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: This builds a hierarchy of movies from `aka_title`, allowing retrieval of linked movies based on `movie_link`.
2. **Aggregate Function (`ActorCount`)**: This computes the count of distinct actors for each movie.
3. **Window Function**: It ranks movies based on actor count for each production year.
4. **Final Selection**: The main query selects titles with more than 5 actors produced after 2000, aggregating actor names into a single string.
5. **String Aggregation**: Utilizes `STRING_AGG` to concatenate actorsâ€™ names.
6. **Complex Filtering**: Enforces multiple predicates for filtering results based on actor count and production year.
