### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE**: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `MovieHierarchy` to retrieve movies from the year 2000 onwards and their linked movies, creating a hierarchy.
2. **LEFT JOINs**: Various tables are joined, such as `complete_cast` and `cast_info`, to obtain details about actors involved in the movies.
3. **Aggregations**: We aggregate actor names using `STRING_AGG` and count actors by creating a distinct list of actors featured in the movie.
4. **Conditional Aggregation**: Using conditional statements, we count roles present in the `cast_info`.
5. **Window Function**: The `MAX` function is used as a window function to find the most recent production year of linked movies.
6. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the production year and actor count for ease in performance analysis.
7. **Filtering**: The query filters results to only show movies with actors, meeting benchmark requirements for meaningful data insights.
