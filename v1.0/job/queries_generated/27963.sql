This query benchmarks string processing by aggregating and joining various tables to extract actor names, movie titles, roles, keywords associated with the movies, and personal information about the actors, filtering for movies produced between 2000 and 2020. It also groups the results to efficiently handle string data while ordering by production year and the order in which actors appeared in the films.
