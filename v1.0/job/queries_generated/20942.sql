This query utilizes CTEs to first gather movies and their associated actors, determining counts and average production years. It further selects the top movie based on actor counts, includes conditional logic for popularity categorization, and performs sub-queries to fetch unique actor counts and names. Additionally, it integrates outer join and complex filter criteria, demonstrating the intricacies of SQL syntax alongside practical application, ensuring rich semantic depth.
