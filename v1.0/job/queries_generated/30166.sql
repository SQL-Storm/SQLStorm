This SQL query uses several complex constructs, including:

1. **Recursive CTE:** The `movie_hierarchy` CTE recursively finds linked movies from the `aka_title` table.
2. **Aggregates and String Aggregation:** It uses `COUNT` and `STRING_AGG` to summarize the cast information and keywords for each movie.
3. **LEFT JOINs:** Used to join movie information with cast and keyword summaries even when there might be no cast or keywords.
4. **COALESCE:** Handles NULL values gracefully, providing default text when there is no cast or keyword info.
5. **CASE Statement:** Categorizes movies based on their production year into specific ranges for easier analysis. 

This query is designed for performance benchmarking, testing the efficiency and execution time against a complex dataset with specific conditions and aggregations.
