### Explanation:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: 
   - `MovieCTE`: A recursive CTE that calculates the average movie ratings for titles released in 2000 or after.
   - `ActorMovies`: Aggregates actor data, counting the number of movies each actor has been involved in, filtering for those with at least 5 movies.

2. **Window Functions**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank movies by their average rating within each production year.

3. **Joins**:
   - Multiple joins are used across various tables (`aka_name`, `cast_info`, etc.) to relate actors with movie titles and ensure comprehensive data extraction.

4. **Complicated WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters final results to include only the top 5 rated movies per year, with an average rating greater than 7.0.

5. **String and NULL handling**: 
   - `COALESCE` ensures that null ratings are treated as zero in aggregate calculations.

6. **Ordering Results**: 
   - The results are ordered by production year and average rating to prioritize the most recent high-rated films. 

This query is designed to provide insights into top rated movies from the 2000s, along with their leading actors, helping to evaluate performance benchmarks effectively.
