This SQL query constructs a recursive CTE to analyze a hierarchy of movies linked together, while also aggregating detailed information about actors' performances across movies produced from the year 2000 onward. The result provides actor names, the titles of the movies, production years, number of appearances, average ratings (considering only those entries classified as ratings), aggregated keywords, and counts of null notes, all while applying complex filters and distinct counts.
