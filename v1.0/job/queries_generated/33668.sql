### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE named `movie_hierarchy` is created to gather all linked movies and their hierarchy, allowing for complex relationships between movies.
2. **SELECT statement**: This aggregates data about actors, including the total number of movies they have appeared in, the average production year of these movies, and a concatenated list of these movies.
3. **CASE Statement**: Used to find out the latest movie by comparing each movie's production year to the maximum production year in the database.
4. **STRING_AGG**: This function concatenates the titles of movies into a single string, separated by commas.
5. **HAVING Clause**: Filters results to include only actors who have appeared in more than 5 movies.
6. **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by the total number of movies in descending order. 

This query is designed to benchmark performance by utilizing various SQL constructs: a recursive CTE, multiple joins, aggregate functions, conditional logic, and string operations.
