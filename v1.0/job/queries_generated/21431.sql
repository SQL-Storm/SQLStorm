This elaborate SQL query accomplishes several tasks:
1. It creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) `RankedMovies` to count the unique actors and rank titles within their production years.
2. It filters and categorizes the movies based on certain conditions in a second CTE `FilteredMovies`.
3. It joins with a subquery to select distinct production years, ensuring that only years with sufficient data are returned.
4. It uses string aggregation to compile lists of titles.
5. It incorporates window functions, correlated subqueries, and complex conditions showcasing varied SQL capabilities.
