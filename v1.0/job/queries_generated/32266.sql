This SQL query achieves the following:

1. Uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of linked movies up to a depth of 10.
2. Joins several tables, including `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and `aka_title`, to gather data on actors, movies, and character details.
3. Employs LEFT JOINs to include production company details and character names effectively, while ensuring that missing data does not exclude results.
4. Filters for movies produced after 2000 and ensures actor names are not null.
5. Groups the results by actor name, movie title, and production year, counting the distinct production companies involved in each movie.
6. Uses the HAVING clause to ensure only movies with at least two production companies are included.
7. Orders the final list by actor name and a calculated movie rank using ROW_NUMBER() to evaluate actorâ€™s works over the years.
