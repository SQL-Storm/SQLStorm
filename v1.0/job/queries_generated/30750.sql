This SQL query accomplishes several objectives:

1. **Recursive CTE**: Utilizes a recursive CTE to gather all linked movies from a starting point of movies produced in the year 2000 or later.

2. **Outer Joins**: Leverages left joins to retrieve cast information, role types, and ratings even if some movies may not have a complete dataset.

3. **Aggregations**: Combines various aggregates including `COUNT` for listing cast members, `STRING_AGG` to present cast details in a readable format, and `AVG` to calculate the average rating.

4. **String Expressions**: Implements string manipulation to create descriptive statuses for movies based on their levels in the hierarchy.

5. **HAVING Clause**: Ensures only movies with cast members are included in the output.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: Applies a subquery to filter out the necessary info types for filtering average ratings from the movie_info table.

7. **Sorting**: Organizes the results to show the most recent movies and their complexity levels, while also sorting based on the number of cast members.

This structure demonstrates complexity and performance evaluation capabilities within the context of a movie database.
