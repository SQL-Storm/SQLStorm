### Explanation of Constructs in the Query:
1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: 
   - This CTE generates a hierarchy of movies and their links, allowing us to capture relationships between movies recursively.
   
2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - LEFT JOIN is used to include titles and their hierarchical relationships, ensuring that we include all relevant data even if there's no direct link or title available.

3. **Window Functions**: 
   - While not explicitly used with an OVER() clause here, the query includes aggregates like COUNT and AVG that could be extended to window functions for more granular insights if necessary.

4. **STRING_AGG**: 
   - This function is utilized to concatenate movie titles into a single string for each actor, showcasing how to handle multiple related entries in a single result.

5. **NULL Logic**: 
   - The use of `COALESCE()` ensures that if any production year is NULL, it defaults to 2000 for the average calculation, ensuring meaningful results.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: 
   - The WHERE clause incorporates several checks to filter results based on non-null and non-empty actor names.

7. **Group By and Having**: 
   - The query groups by actor names and restricts the results to those who have been involved in more than 5 movies.

Using these constructs makes the query complex and capable of benchmarking performance across joins, aggregations, and hierarchical data relationships.
