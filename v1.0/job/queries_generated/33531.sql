This query benchmarks performance by creating a recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) to include movies produced after 2000 and their linked movies. It utilizes outer joins and a window function to aggregate data related to the cast and keywords associated with the movies, while also including safeguards for NULL values using a `CASE` expression. The results are grouped and ordered for analysis on cast size.
