This query performs the following steps:

1. **Recursive CTE** (`MovieHierarchy`): Builds a hierarchy of movies linked together through `movie_link`.

2. **ActorMovieInfo CTE**: Aggregates information about actors, collecting their movie roles, production years, and associated keywords. It uses `COALESCE` to handle NULL values.

3. **HighRatedMovies CTE**: Calculates the average rating for each movie (assuming a `ratings` table exists).

4. The final SELECT statement retrieves actor names, movie titles, production years, average ratings, and counts of roles and noted roles â€” filtering for movies with an average rating of 8 or higher.

5. The output is sorted by year, then average rating, and total roles, focusing on the highest-rated movies from the most recent year. The LIMIT clause restricts the results to the top 50 records.
