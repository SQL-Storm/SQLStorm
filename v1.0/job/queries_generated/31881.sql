This SQL query performs various complex operations and utilizes constructs such as:
- A recursive common table expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of movies linked to movies produced from 2000 onwards.
- Aggregation functions like `COUNT` and `SUM` to calculate total cast members and filter recently produced films.
- The `STRING_AGG` function combines cast notes into a single string.
- `COALESCE` to handle NULL values in audience ratings.
- LEFT JOINs combined with correlated subqueries for deeper insights into relationships among actors and their films.
- Grouping and sorting the results based on specified criteria to facilitate performance benchmarking.
