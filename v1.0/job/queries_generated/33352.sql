This SQL query utilizes various constructs, including:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of movies linked together from the base dataset filtered by a certain production year.
- Multiple outer joins to connect various related tables, fetching details related to actors, keywords, and complete cast structures.
- Aggregate functions like COUNT and SUM, combined with conditional logic, to derive insights such as actor counts and the presence of notes.
- A window function (ROW_NUMBER) to rank the results based on actor counts per movie.
- Several filters and predicates that ensure the results align with the intended parameters, such as filtering for production years and conditions on the hierarchy level.

This comprehensive query is ideal for performance benchmarking due to its complexity and diverse SQL features.
