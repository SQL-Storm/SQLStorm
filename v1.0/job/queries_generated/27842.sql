### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
   - `RankedMovies`: This CTE aggregates movies from the `aka_title` table, joining with `movie_companies`, `company_name`, `complete_cast`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`, and `movie_keyword` tables. It counts distinct cast members and aggregates aliases and keywords associated with each movie.
   - `TopMovies`: This CTE ranks the movies based on the count of cast members.

2. **Query Selection:**
   - The main SELECT statement retrieves data from the `TopMovies` CTE where it filters for the top 10 movies by cast count.

3. **Output:**
   - It includes columns for rank, movie title, production year, company name, the count of cast members, a list of alias names, and associated keywords.

4. **Filtering Criteria:**
   - The movies considered must be produced in or after the year 2000. 

This SQL query is designed to benchmark string processing by leveraging STRING_AGG for handling multiple names and keywords for each movie, thus testing the database's capacity to perform complex string manipulations and aggregations efficiently.
