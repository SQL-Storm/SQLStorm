This elaborate SQL query performs the following operations to benchmark string processing:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedTitles`: Ranks actors for each movie by name within the same production year.
   - `TitleKeywords`: Aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a comma-separated string.

2. **Main Query**: Selects the title ID, title, production year, actor name, actor rank, and keywords for movies produced in or after 2000, restricting the results to the top 3 actors per movie.

3. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by production year in descending order and then by actor rank in ascending order. 

This complex query showcases multiple joins, string aggregation, and window functions â€” ideal for benchmarking string processing performance in SQL.
