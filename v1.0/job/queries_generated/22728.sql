### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** - Three CTEs: 
   - `ranked_movies`: Ranks movies by their title within each production year.
   - `movie_cast`: Aggregates total number of distinct cast members per movie, and lists their names.
   - `detailed_movie_info`: Joins the previous CTEs and fetches additional keyword information, handling NULLs with `COALESCE` for cases without keywords.

2. **Correlated Subqueries** - Used to count plots and aggregate casting notes: 
   - Provides additional insights about the movies based on related data.

3. **Aggregate Functions** - `COUNT`, `STRING_AGG`, and subquery with `GROUP_CONCAT`.

4. **NULL Logic** - Uses `COALESCE` to handle NULLs and provides meaningful defaults.

5. **CASE Statement** - Outputs a friendly cast status based on the presence of cast information.

6. **String Aggregation** - Combines multiple string outputs into a single line.

7. **Complicated Predicates** - Filtering movies produced from the year 2000 onward.

8. **Ordering and Limiting** - Final result sorted by `production_year` and `title`, limited to 100 records for performance benchmarking.

Each part of this query explores various features and potential complexities present in the SQL language concerning the relationships defined in the schema provided.
