This SQL query generates a comprehensive performance benchmark by utilizing various constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, outer joins, and grouping logic. The query aims to extract information about movies produced after the year 2000, focusing on movies with a substantial cast, while also retrieving related additional information about the cinematographer, if available. It showcases the SQL engine's ability to process hierarchical relationships and aggregate functions efficiently.
