This SQL query combines various SQL constructs such as a recursive CTE for hierarchically linked movies, outer joins, window functions for ranking, and filtering through complicated predicates and NULL logic to yield a comprehensive overview of actors in movies, their casts, and keywords associated while complying with specific criteria.
