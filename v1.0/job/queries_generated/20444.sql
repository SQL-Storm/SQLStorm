This SQL query performs a sophisticated performance benchmarking operation over the provided movie schema. It includes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to derive the highest-ranked movies from each production year, aggregate co-actors, and extract keywords associated with each movie. Several advanced SQL concepts are demonstrated, including conditional logic, outer joins, and string aggregation. Additionally, it applies complicated predicates and expressions for filtering and includes NULL logic to handle absent data gracefully. The query is designed to retrieve data efficiently while also demonstrating a deep understanding of SQL's capabilities.
