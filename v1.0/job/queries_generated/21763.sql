This query does the following:
1. Defines a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) `MovieHierarchy` that builds a hierarchy of movies based on linked movies, with depth indicated.
2. Joins the `cast_info`, `aka_name`, and the recursive CTE to get actors along with their corresponding movies, considering multiple levels of movie links.
3. Uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include movie keywords and movie info, specifically looking for a rating.
4. Implements several advanced constructs:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking within each actor.
   - `COUNT()` with a conditional expression to count non-null information entries.
   - The `COALESCE` function to manage cases where a keyword might not exist, defaulting to 'No Keyword'.
5. Utilizes a case expression to handle null actor names, showing 'Unknown Actor' when needed.
6. Applies complicated predicates in the WHERE clause, filtering based on depth, md5sum, and the non-existence of specific companies.
7. Orders the results by actor name and movie depth in descending order.

This elaborate query aims to provide insights into the performance of retrieving actor and movie linkage data while handling complex SQL constructs and edge cases in the context of the provided schema.
