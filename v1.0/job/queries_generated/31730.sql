This SQL query incorporates several advanced SQL features such as:

1. **Recursive CTEs**: Used to build a hierarchy of movies where episodes are linked to their parent series.

2. **LEFT JOINS**: To incorporate data from multiple tables, ensuring all movies are represented even if they lack certain related information.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: `ARRAY_AGG()` to collect actor names into an array, and `COUNT()` to get the total number of actors and episodes.

4. **CASE Statements**: To conditionally retrieve information, like the movie description based only on a specific `info_type_id`.

5. **Grouping and Ordering**: Allow for structured output organized by release year and movie title.

6. **Filters**: Implementing NULL logic and string expressions to filter out unwanted data.

This query will provide a thorough overview of movies along with their keywords, actor names, and some additional information, suitable for performance benchmarking.
