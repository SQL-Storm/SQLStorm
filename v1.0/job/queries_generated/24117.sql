This SQL query is structured with various constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, subqueries, NULL logic, and conditional statements. It ranks movies, counts associated companies, and evaluates their funding based on the number of distinct companies. Furthermore, it considers edge cases with NULL values in joins and leverages string aggregation to list starring actors. The query also features unusual conditions and complex logical groupings to highlight its elaborate nature.
