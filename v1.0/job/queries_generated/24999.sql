This SQL query employs various advanced constructs: 

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to recursively build a hierarchy of related movies.
2. **Window functions** to calculate the average production year of movies per actor.
3. **LEFT JOINs** to include all actors, regardless of whether they have associated keywords or related movies.
4. **Aggregate functions** to gather related movies into an array while ensuring there's an evaluation for non-null status.
5. **Complicated predicates** such as checking for non-null names and certain production years.
6. **Conditional logic** via the CASE statement to handle edge cases for related movies, showcasing bizarre logic when counts are null.
7. **Array Aggregation** for compactly grouping related movie titles from the hierarchy.

This query could serve a performance benchmarking purpose as it includes multiple dependencies, diverse joins, and aggregate calculations over potentially large datasets.
