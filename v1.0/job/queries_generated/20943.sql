### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Utilized a recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) to create a hierarchy of movies based on whether they have episodes, preserving levels of hierarchy.
- **LEFT JOINs**: Employed multiple left joins to gather data from various tables like `cast_info`, `aka_name`, and `movie_info`.
- **Aggregation Functions**: Used `ARRAY_AGG` for actor names and `COUNT` to determine the status of the actors efficiently.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied `COALESCE` to handle potential `NULL` values gracefully.
- **Complicated WHERE Clause**: Chained conditions for `info_type_id` to filter for genres while also allowing retrieval of other kinds of info.
- **Depth Limiting**: Introduced a limit to depth in the movie hierarchy to optimize performance.
- **ORDER BY with Limiting**: Results are sorted by production year and level, while limiting the output to 100 rows for quicker response time.

This query both serves as a performance benchmark and challenges the SQL engine with multiple complex constructs.
