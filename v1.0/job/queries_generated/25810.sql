### Explanation:

1. **RankedMovies CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the total number of cast members for each movie and aggregates their names into a single string. It ranks movies within each production year based on the number of cast members.

2. **TopMovies CTE**: This CTE selects the top 5 movies for each production year based on the number of cast members.

3. **Final SELECT**: This query aggregates keyword counts associated with the top movies and computes the average length of specific info types (identified by their ID). It groups by movie details and orders by production year and total cast members, allowing for an insightful view of string processing performance and relationships.

This query is structured to benchmark query performance related to string processing through aggregation and string manipulation functions, making it both complex and interesting.
