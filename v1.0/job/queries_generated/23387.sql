This SQL query performs the following:

1. **CTE for Movie Series**: Recursively retrieves movies and their corresponding episodes while maintaining a depth count for series, which helps in identifying the layers of a series.
   
2. **Actor Details**: It captures actors along with their roles in a specific movie, using window functions to order roles of each actor.

3. **Keyword Aggregation**: Collects all distinct keywords associated with each movie into an array.

4. **Movie Info Details**: Gathers additional information related to movies, aggregating the details into a single string per movie.

5. **Final Selection**: Combines data from all CTEs to produce a normalized output, including titles, actors, keywords, depth, and additional info while applying various filtering predicates, including NULL handling and conditional depth logic. 

6. **Ordering and Limiting**: The query orders the results by movie title and actor role order, returning the first 100 records. 

The complexity of the query engages various SQL features, illustrating the powerful querying capabilities while navigating semantic caveatsâ€”particularly regarding NULL handling, recursion, and aggregates/types.
