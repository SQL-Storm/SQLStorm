This SQL query uses several constructs for performance benchmarking, including:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies based on linked movies.
2. **Outer joins**: Multiple left joins to gather data from various tables to ensure we capture all relevant movies, cast, and information.
3. **Aggregations**: `COUNT`, `STRING_AGG`, and `AVG`/`MAX` functions to summarize data, including the total count of cast members, names of actors, average budget, and maximum gross revenue.
4. **Group by**: Groups results by movie details.
5. **Complicated predicates**: Filtering movies by conditions on the levels of the hierarchy and specific requirements on the reviewer statistics (`HAVING` clause).
6. **String expressions**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate actor names into a single string.
7. **NULL logic**: Handles cases where budget or gross values might not be present. 

This query aims to fetch interesting insights into movies, particularly focusing on those with significant cast involvement and financial metrics.
