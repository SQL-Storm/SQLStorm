This SQL query is elaborate and incorporates the following constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies from the `aka_title` and `title` tables, allowing for recursive exploration of movies linked to one another.
  
2. **Outer Joins**: Various outer joins are used to ensure complete data retrieval, such as those between `aka_title`, `cast_info`, and `person_info`.

3. **Aggregations**: The query counts distinct cast members and strings names together, which involves `COUNT` and `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Correlated Subqueries**: The use of correlated subqueries retrieves specific information types such as height and birth date from `person_info`.

5. **Complicated predicates/expressions**: The filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause focus on movies produced after 2000 and ensure that only those with more than 5 distinct cast members are selected.

6. **String expressions**: The use of `STRING_AGG` provides a concatenated list of cast names for each movie.

7. **NULL logic**: Usage of `COALESCE` ensures that default values are provided for potential nulls in movie names.

The structure is designed for performance benchmarking by testing query characteristics in a complex environment.
