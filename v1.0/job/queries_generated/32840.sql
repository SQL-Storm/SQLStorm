### Explanation:

1. **Recursive CTE**: 
   - The `MovieHierarchy` CTE starts from movies released from the year 2000 onward and recursively joins to find episodes belonging to series, maintaining a hierarchy.

2. **Selection of Actors and Movies**: 
   - The main query selects actor names and their associated movies' titles and production years. It uses a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` to include actors who might not have roles in movies from the hierarchy.

3. **Aggregations and Window Functions**: 
   - The `COUNT(DISTINCT c.movie_id)` counts the distinct movies each actor has participated in.
   - The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a rank to actors based on the latest production year of movies theyâ€™re involved in.

4. **CASE Statement**: 
   - It evaluates whether the actor has a note associated with their role.

5. **Group and Filter**: 
   - It groups the results by actor and movie information, filtering to include only actors involved in more than one movie.

6. **Order By**: 
   - Results are ordered first by the count of movies and then alphabetically by the actor's name. 

This complex query provides a detailed look into actors' performances over a period, including series roles, while applying various SQL constructs to enhance the output.
