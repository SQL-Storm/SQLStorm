This SQL query uses multiple advanced constructs:
1. A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of movies linked together, limiting the depth to avoid inefficiencies.
2. Aggregate functions to calculate movie counts and average production years.
3. A `STRING_AGG` function to concatenate keywords associated with the movies.
4. Window functions to rank actors based on their movie counts.
5. Complicated predicates in the `WHERE` clause, including checks for `NULL`, to further refine results.
6. The query uses outer joins to include keywords, ensuring that actors without associated keywords are still considered, and filtered results to focus on more recent films.
