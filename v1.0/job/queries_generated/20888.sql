This SQL query showcases various advanced constructs including:

- CTEs: `movie_hierarchy` is used to create a hierarchy of movies with their basic information and aggregated actor names. 
- Recursive Queries: Used in `movie_hierarchy`, allows for expansion on movie data if necessary.
- Outer Joins: Left joins incorporate various tables allowing for non-matching records to still be part of the output.
- Correlated Subqueries: They calculate `cast_count` and aggregate `keywords` for each filtered movie.
- STRING_AGG: aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a single string.
- Complex predicates: are used in the `WHERE` clause, filtering out banned titles, accounting for NULL values, and assigning popularity status based on the actor count.
- Use of COALESCE and NULLIF for handling potential null or empty values in the results.
- The final result set limits the ranking to the top 5 per year and sorts movies in the descending order by production year.

Overall, it combines various SQL features in a nuanced way to deliver a detailed report on movie statistics while adhering to performance benchmarking principles.
