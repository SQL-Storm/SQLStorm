### Explanation of Constructs Used:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: Three CTEs (`ranked_movies`, `cast_aggregates`, and `top_titles`) are created to organize and aggregate data efficiently.
   
2. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank movie roles per year, while `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` is used to calculate the number of unique cast members.

3. **Outer Joins**: `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that we retain movies that may not have a lead actor or keywords associated with them.

4. **Complicated Conditions**: The query includes a conditional statement to categorize movies based on the number of casts.

5. **NULL Handling**: The use of `COALESCE` ensures that if there is no known lead actor, we return 'Unknown'.

6. **Aggregates**: The use of aggregations like `COUNT()` and `MAX()` joins various levels of grouped data about the movies and cast.

7. **Ordering**: The final output is ordered by production year descending, followed by the total cast in descending order, showing the latest and most populated films first.

8. **String Expressions and NULL Logic**: The query includes conditional checks and COALESCE for displaying default values when data is missing.

This SQL query could serve as a performance benchmark while demonstrating complex SQL functionalities, suitable for further testing with indexes or execution plans.
