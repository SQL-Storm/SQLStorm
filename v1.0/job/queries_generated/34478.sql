### Explanation:
This query performs several operations for performance benchmarking:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: `actor_hierarchy` recursively collects all actors involved in the movie titled "Inception" by traversing through their roles in the cast info.

2. **Aggregation**: It counts the total number of movies each actor worked in and lists all their titles. It also calculates the latest and earliest movie production years along with the average production year.

3. **Conditional Logic**: It utilizes a `CASE` statement to classify actors based on their latest movie's production year.

4. **Filtering**: It uses a window function with a FILTER clause to count how many of their movies fall under the "thriller" keyword.

5. **NULL Logic**: The `COALESCE` function is used to handle null values in the average calculation. 

6. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG` combines movie titles into a single string separated by commas.

7. **Ordering and Limiting Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by the count of movies (descending) for getting the top actors.

This combination of techniques makes the query complex while effectively demonstrating SQL performance through various constructs.
