This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)**: It builds a hierarchy of movies by linking movies to their related ones, allowing depth traversal up to three levels starting from movies produced from the year 2000 onwards.
   
2. **SELECT Clause**: It retrieves the movie title, counts the unique actors involved per movie, aggregates their names into a comma-separated string, calculates the average production year of the films, and identifies a featured keyword for each movie.

3. **LEFT JOINs**: It combines various tables (like `cast_info`, `aka_name`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword`) to gather necessary data.

4. **GROUP BY Clause**: Results are grouped by the movie ID and title to summarize data.

5. **ORDER BY Clause**: The output is ordered first by the count of actors, then by the average production year.

6. **LIMIT Clause**: It restricts the output to the top 10 movies for improved performance in benchmarking.

This elaborate query structure highlights the performance measurement across different aspects of movie relationships, casts, and extra attributes like keywords and production years while ensuring potential complexities for benchmarking purposes.
