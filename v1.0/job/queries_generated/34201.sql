### Explanation:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**:
   - **MovieHierarchy**: A recursive CTE that constructs a hierarchy of movies linked together through the `movie_link` table. This helps identify related movies that might be sequels or remakes.

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - Joining multiple tables (`aka_name`, `cast_info`, `aka_title`, etc.) to gather information about actors, the movies they appeared in, and related details.

3. **LEFT JOINs**:
   - Used to include additional data such as keywords and information about the roles of actors, even if some of these records are NULL.

4. **Window Function**:
   - The `DENSE_RANK()` function is used to rank roles within each movie. This might help in understanding the importance or order of roles played.

5. **Aggregation Functions**:
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT C.movie_id)` gives the count of unique movies per actor.
   - `ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT kw.keyword)` collects all unique keywords associated with the movies.

6. **Average Calculation**:
   - A derived average to check the prevalence of information related to movies.

7. **Predicates**:
   - A condition checks if the actor's name isnâ€™t NULL or empty.
   - A constraint on hierarchy levels of movies to limit the depth of the search.

8. **ORDER BY and LIMIT**:
   - Orders the final result by the total number of movies and average information count, limiting the output to the top 10 results. 

This query would provide a performance benchmark by demonstrating the use of complex SQL capabilities such as recursion, window functions, and complex joins while also testing the efficiency of aggregating data in a relational database context.
