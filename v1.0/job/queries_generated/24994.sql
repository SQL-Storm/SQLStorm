### Explanation of the Query Components:
1. **CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE movie_hierarchy`)**: This produces a recursive structure of sequels linking movies through `movie_link`, allowing us to count the number of sequels for each movie.

2. **Main SELECT Query**:
   - **Actor Name and Movie Title**: We fetch the actorâ€™s name from `aka_name` and the title of the movie.
   - **Company Type**: We gather movie companies' types with an outer join on `movie_companies` and `company_type` tables.
   - **Count of Companies**: Count distinct companies associated with each movie.
   - **Average Production Year**: Average the production years (only movies after 2000).
   - **Count of Sequels**: Count the number of linked sequels derived from the CTE.
   - **Keyword Aggregation**: Aggregate movie keywords into a comma-separated string.
   - **Birth Date**: A correlated subquery to get the birth date of the actor (if it exists).
   - **NULL Logic**: Count movies with a null production year which adds ambiguity to the data.

3. **WHERE Clause**: Filtering for valid actor names and peculiar conditions on `movie_info`.

4. **GROUP BY and HAVING**: Aggregating the results based on actors and titles, and ensuring certain conditions are met (like having more than one company). The `HAVING` clause adds a nuance by enforcing logical criteria on aggregated columns.

5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Orders results first by the number of sequels in descending order and then by actor name, making results easier to analyze.

This query utilizes a variety of SQL features to demonstrate complexity while also handling potential edge cases in the dataset.
