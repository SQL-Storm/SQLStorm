In this SQL query, several advanced constructs are utilized. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components used:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `movie_hierarchy` CTE allows for navigating hierarchical movie links (linked movies), recursively building a movie tree.

2. **Joins**: Different join types are employed, including inner joins (`JOIN`) for mandatory relationships and left joins (`LEFT JOIN`) to include optional data like keywords and ratings.

3. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a rank to movies per actor based on the most recent production year.

4. **Aggregation**: The query counts the distinct keywords associated with each movie, averages ratings, and groups results by actor and movie title.

5. **Conditional Logic**: The `CASE` statement evaluates whether or not there are keywords present and helps to create a status label.

6. **NULL Handling**: It uses `COALESCE` to ensure that if there are no keywords, a fallback message is provided.

7. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG` is used to concatenate keywords into a single string (if any). 

8. **HAVING Clause**: It filters results based on condition by counting NULL occurrences of keywords.

This query is both comprehensive and complex, providing extensive data insights while showcasing the potential for advanced SQL techniques.
