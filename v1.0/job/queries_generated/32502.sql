This SQL query performs the following operations:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: Constructs a hierarchy of movies produced after 2000, pulling linked movies through the `movie_link` table, while categorizing the levels.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins multiple tables (`complete_cast`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword`) to obtain data about actors, the movies they participated in, and associated keywords.
   - Uses conditional logic by utilizing `COALESCE` to handle the possibility of missing keywords.
   - Applies the `RANK()` window function to create a ranking of actors based on their appearances in movies for a given year.
   - Filters out actors without a name and only includes entries where an actor has appeared in more than one movie.
   - Groups the results by actor name, movie title, production year, and keyword.
   - Orders the results by production year (descending) and actor rank to provide a structured view of actorsâ€™ contributions across years.

This query can be utilized for benchmarking performance related to complex joins, subqueries, and aggregate calculations.
