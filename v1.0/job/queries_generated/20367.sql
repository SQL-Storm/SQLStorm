### Explanation:
1. **CTEs used**:
   - **RankedTitles**: Ranks titles by year. Contains only non-null years.
   - **ActorRoleCounts**: Counts the number of movies and distinct roles for each actor.
   - **MoviesWithKeyword**: Aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a single string.

2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - Left joins are used to connect titles with actor counts and keyword lists, accommodating scenarios where actors may not be associated with any titles or keywords.

3. **Window Functions**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is used in `RankedTitles` to rank titles for each production year.

4. **CASE Statement**:
   - Categorizes actors based on the number of movies they have appeared in.

5. **COALESCE**:
   - Handles NULL values for keywords, providing a default string if no keywords are found. 

6. **Complexity in filtering**:
   - Filters to only include the top-ranked titles of each year with detailed actor statistics and keyword aggregation.

7. **Order by multiple fields**:
   - Results are ordered first by production year, then by actor movie count, and title.

This query provides comprehensive information for performance benchmarking in a complex relational environment, while managing some obscure SQL semantics such as handling NULLs, string aggregation, and complex joins.
