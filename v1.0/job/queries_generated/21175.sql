### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE named `MovieHierarchy` is created to build a hierarchy of movies based on links between them.
2. **Aggregation & Analysis**: The main query aggregates various data:
   - Collects distinct titles associated with a person.
   - Calculates the latest production year for the movies associated with that person.
   - Counts how many linked movies each person has.
   - Sums a conditional case to count cast entries that have a non-null order.
   - Aggregates distinct keywords associated with those movies.
3. **Filters and Grouping**: The query filters out entries with a NULL `md5sum`, groups the results by person name, and ensures only details for people with more than one linked movie are returned.
4. **Pagination**: Finally, it uses `OFFSET` and `FETCH NEXT` for pagination, allowing retrieving a specific subset of results.

This query showcases several advanced features like recursive CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, and NULL handling, wrapped in a complex join structure to analyze movie casting relationships.
