This elaborately constructed SQL query accomplishes several tasks:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)** to construct a hierarchy of movies linked to one another and produced after the year 2000.
2. **LEFT JOIN** to aggregate information from various related tables, ensuring all actors are included even if they haven't acted in a movie linked in `MovieHierarchy`.
3. **Aggregates**:
   - Counts distinct movies for each actor.
   - Computes the average production year of their movies.
   - Counts and concatenates associated keywords for those movies.
4. **NULL Handling** using `COALESCE` to prevent null values in average calculations.
5. **Filtering with `WHERE`** clause to ensure that the actor's name is meaningful.
6. **Grouping** to compile results per actor and maintaining a **HAVING** clause to exclude actors with no movies.
7. **Ordering** results by descending total number of movies.

This query is comprehensive and utilizes various SQL constructs, allowing for a robust performance benchmarking analysis.
