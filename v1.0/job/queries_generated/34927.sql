This comprehensive SQL query includes several advanced SQL constructs:

- A recursive common table expression (CTE) to create a hierarchy of movies associated with each title, specifically movies linked to titles produced after 2000.
- Subqueries utilized for extracting the `info_type_id` within `CASE` statements to handle total budget and maximum rating calculations.
- Window functions are used for aggregation across partitions based on movie and actor, providing counts and summaries.
- Outer joins accommodate situations where certain relationships (like keywords or info types) might be absent, while still returning meaningful results.
- NULL handling using `COALESCE` and conditional aggregations gives a robust output under circumstances where data might be missing. 
- String expressions ensure that all relevant data is formatted appropriately. 

This complex query can be utilized for performance benchmarking by measuring execution time and examining the query plan.
