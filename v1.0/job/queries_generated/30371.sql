### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: This CTE recursively retrieves movies produced after 2000 and their linked movies to generate a hierarchy of films based on links.
2. **CTE for Keywords (`MovieKeywords`)**: Aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a concatenated string format.
3. **Top Movies CTE**: Ranks the movies based on the most recent release year, segregated by the hierarchy level.
4. **Final Selection**: Retrieves the top 10 movies from the constructed hierarchy along with their production year, keywords (if any), and categorizes them into 'Top 5' or 'Other' based on their rank.
5. **NULL Handling**: Utilizes `COALESCE` to replace missing keyword data with a default message.
