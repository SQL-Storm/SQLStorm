### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  1. **RecursiveMovieTree**: Captures movie titles associated with companies from 2000 onward and builds a recursive relationship for linked movies.
  2. **DistinctKeywords**: Extracts distinct keywords associated with each movie.
  3. **RankedMovies**: Ranks movies per company by production year.

- **Query Logic**:
  - The main query selects movies' titles, associated companies, and counts distinct keywords.
  - The `CASE` statement handles NULL values for production years,Returning 'No Productions' where there are none.
  - The `HAVING` clause ensures only movies with more than five distinct keywords are considered in the final results.

- **Complex Features**:
  - Recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to handle multi-level movie links.
  - Use of `ROW_NUMBER()` window function for ranking.
  - NULL handling and COALESCE for default values in joins.
  - DISTINCT keyword count to aggregate insights per movie. 

This SQL query includes intricate details and demonstrates advanced SQL functionalities suitable for performance benchmarking.
