This query includes the following constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: To build a hierarchy of movies and episodes.
2. **Aggregation (`MovieWithKeywords`)**: To gather keywords associated with each movie.
3. **Subqueries (`PersonRoleCounts`, `TopPersons`)**: To count roles by person and select the top actors based on their role counts.
4. **Outer Joins**: To ensure we get all movies, even those without keywords or listed persons.
5. **COALESCE**: To handle NULL values for movie keywords.
6. **Complicated predicates**: Filtering movies produced after 2000 and actors with over 5 roles.
7. **Ordering**: To present results ordered by production year, hierarchy level, and role count. 

This complex query performs multiple levels of analysis, aimed at performance benchmarking.
