This query showcases several advanced SQL constructs suitable for performance benchmarking. It includes a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) for creating a hierarchy of movies, outer joins to handle optional relationships, aggregation with a conditional and a subquery for fetching actor information, along with grouping and ordering to generate the output. Additionally, it employs string aggregation to consolidate keywords and filtering with complicated predicates.
