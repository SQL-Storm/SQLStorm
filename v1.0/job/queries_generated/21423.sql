This SQL query generates a comprehensive report on movies produced after 2000, leveraging recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to establish movie linkage, counting actors in each movie, aggregating genres, and calculating average ratingsâ€”all while taking into account various corner cases like NULL values and unusual join conditions. It employs string aggregation, outer joins, and subqueries to create a rich dataset ready for performance benchmarking.
