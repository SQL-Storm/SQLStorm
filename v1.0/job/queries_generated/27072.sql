This SQL query does the following:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `ranked_titles`: Rank each title based on the count of associated keywords, partitioned by production year, to identify the most popular title of each year.
   - `most_popular_titles`: Select the top-ranked title for each production year.
   - `actor_movie_info`: Gather information on the actors and the number of roles for each movie title.

2. **Final Query**: 
   - Join the most popular titles with the actor movie information to compile a comprehensive list that displays each actor's name along with the title and production year of the most popular movie, and counts the number of roles each actor played for that movie.
  
3. **Ordering**: 
   - Results are ordered by production year in descending order and then by role count in descending order, to emphasize recent popular titles with prolific actors. 

This intricate query merges multiple aspects of the schema focusing on string processing via keyword associations and actors' contributions within the title context.
