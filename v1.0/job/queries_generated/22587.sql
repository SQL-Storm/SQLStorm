This SQL query creates a comprehensive report on movies, their actors, and relevant keywords. It showcases a variety of SQL constructs, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions for ranking and counting, grouping, and conditional expressions to analyze cast quality and movie potential. The use of outer joins and string aggregation introduces complexity reflective of real-world scenarios, making it suitable for performance benchmarking.
