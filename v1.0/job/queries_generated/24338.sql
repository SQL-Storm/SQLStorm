### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies` calculates the number of actors for each movie and ranks them per production year.
   - `TopMovies` selects the top 5 movies per production year based on the actor count.
   - `MovieDetails` aggregates associated companies and keywords for the selected top movies.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - The LEAD function is used to fetch the count of actors from the next movie in the ordered set.

3. **Complex Predicates**: 
   - The usage of COALESCE and NULLIF allows for sophisticated handling of NULL values.

4. **String Aggregation**:
   - STRING_AGG is used to construct a list of companies and keywords associated with each movie.

5. **Case Statement**:
   - Categorizes movies as 'Above Average' or 'Below Average' based on their actor count compared to the average actor count.

6. **Filtering**:
   - The final output is limited to the top 10 movies based on actor count.
