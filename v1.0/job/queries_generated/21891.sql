This SQL query performs a series of complex operations to output titles along with actor names and the count of keywords associated with each title. It utilizes several advanced SQL features including:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Four CTEs (`RankedMovies`, `TopActors`, `ActorsByTitle`, and `KeywordCounts`) serve different purposes: ranking movies by year, ranking actors by movie appearance, filtering title/actor pairs, and counting keywords for each movie.

2. **Window Functions**: Both `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` are utilized to rank movies and actors. 

3. **LEFT JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN**: These joins are used to combine data from various sources while addressing potential NULLs in actor names and keyword counts.

4. **COALESCE**: This function substitutes a zero count for movies with no associated keywords.

5. **Complex Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause combines conditions on actor ranks and includes NULL checks for additional flexibility.

6. **NULL Logic**: The use of `IS NULL` and `COALESCE` helps to manage NULLs, ensuring they don't affect the output negatively.

7. **Ordering**: The output is ordered by the production year in descending order and then by title for clarity in results.

This elaborate query could serve as an effective benchmark for performance testing within the specified Join Order Benchmark schema.
