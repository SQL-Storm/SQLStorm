### Explanation of SQL Constructs Used:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RecursiveTitles`: This CTE ranks titles by year.
   - `CompanyData`: It gathers company information related to movies including the count of companies.
   - `MovieWithRoles`: It counts distinct roles and total cast members for each movie.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` in `RecursiveTitles` to rank titles within their production year.

3. **Outer Joins**:
   - Left joins are utilized to ensure that even if there are no companies or roles associated with a title, the title still appears in the results.

4. **Correlated Subqueries**:
   - The `CASE` statement includes a correlated subquery to count linked movies.

5. **Set Operators**:
   - The condition in the `CASE` statements uses set logic.

6. **NULL Logic**:
   - `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, and conditional checks maximize the inclusivity of results while specifying default behaviors.

7. **String Expressions**:
   - The query checks for company names starting with 'A'.

8. **Complex Predicates**:
   - WHERE clause combines multiple conditions reflecting the complexity of filtering results.

This query serves as a performance benchmark, demonstrating various SQL capabilities while working with the provided schema.
