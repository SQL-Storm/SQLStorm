This SQL query performs an elaborate performance benchmarking operation by leveraging Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and various SQL constructs. It captures the movie hierarchy and provides various statistics about the movies and their associated cast, keywords, and companies. It also showcases the use of window functions, conditional aggregation, string aggregation, and handling of NULL values.
