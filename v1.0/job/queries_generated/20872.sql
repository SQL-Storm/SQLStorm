### Explanation of SQL Constructs:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `RankedMovies` CTE ranks movies by the number of distinct actors per production year.
   - `FilteredMovies` CTE selects the top 5 movies per production year based on actor count.

2. **Window Functions**: 
   - `RANK()` is used to create a ranking of movies based on the count of distinct actors.

3. **Left Joins**: 
   - Joins between titles, cast info, aka names, and movie keywords to gather detailed information.

4. **Aggregations**: 
   - `ARRAY_AGG` is used to collect actor names and keywords, with filtering to manage NULL values.
   - `COUNT` and conditional expressions in aggregations to get counts of keywords and determine notes status.

5. **Filters on Aggregation**: 
   - The query uses the `HAVING` clause to enforce conditions on aggregates, such as checking for non-null `kind`.

6. **Complex Case Logic**: 
   - Using `CASE` to provide a human-readable status based on the presence of notes.

7. **NULL Logic**: 
   - Utilizing `COALESCE` and `FILTER` in aggregation to handle and prioritize values, taking care of NULL entries effectively.

8. **Complicated Predicates and Calculations**: 
   - Various calculated fields to summarize the data and apply transformations.

This SQL statement combines multiple complex elements into a comprehensive performance benchmarking scenario while ensuring it engages with various facets of SQL semantics and practices.
