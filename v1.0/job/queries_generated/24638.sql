### Explanation of Complexity:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `WITH RankedMovies` clause calculates the rank of movies based on the number of cast entries and groups them by production year.
2. **Window Functions**: The query uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank movies within each production year based on the count of not-null notes in `cast_info`.
3. **LEFT JOINs and Correlated Subqueries**: The query incorporates several LEFT JOINs, one of which has a correlated subquery to gather actors from `cast_info` related to `movie_info` notes concerning awards.
4. **NULL Logic**: The `COALESCE` function is utilized for effective company counts, which defaults to 1 if no companies exist.
5. **STRING_AGG**: It aggregates actor names into a single string for output.
6. **Case Statement**: Categorizes movies based on their ranks into distinct types.
7. **HAVING Clause**: Ensures only movies with cast members are included, adding another level of semantic complexity.
8. **Order By**: Finally, the results are ordered by production year descending and by rank. 

This query effectively combines many SQL features to provide a rich dataset while performing performance benchmarking against the expected SQL constructs.
