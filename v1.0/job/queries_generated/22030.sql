This SQL query leverages several advanced features and constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for recursive role counting, ranking of movies per year, calculating keyword statistics, and capturing actor statistics.
2. **Aggregations** using `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `COALESCE` to handle NULL values efficiently.
3. **Window Functions** to rank movies while partitioning by year.
4. **Left Joins** for optional relationships, showcasing how to handle missing data with NULL logic.
5. **UNIQUE Constraints** on movie keywords combined with subquery logic to filter by awards count.
6. **Complex predicates** in `WHERE` to filter actor results based on their total number of roles or top-ranked movie appearances.
7. **Use of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`** to implement pagination, which can be relevant for performance benchmarking scenarios. 

This showcases a diverse range of SQL functionality while returning potentially insightful data.
