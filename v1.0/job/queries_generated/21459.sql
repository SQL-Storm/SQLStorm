### Explanation of Query Components:
1. **CTEs**: The query consists of two Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
   - `RecursiveMovies` gathers movie data along with their related company types and a count of cast members.
   - `MovieDetails` enriches the data with additional details such as the count of associated info records and a concatenated list of keywords.

2. **Outer Joins**: The use of `LEFT JOIN` for various tables ensures that all movies are included, even if certain related records are missing (e.g., companies or cast information).

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Inside `MovieDetails`, subqueries fetch counts related to info and keywords associated with each movie.

4. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to rank movies within their production years, although not actively used in the final selection, it illustrates advanced analytical capabilities.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: Includes various conditions in the `WHERE` clause that handle NULL values and specific ranges, as well as a LIKE match for keywords.

6. **String Expressions**: The concatenation of keywords using `STRING_AGG()` demonstrates handling of string data types and aggregation.

7. **NULL Logic**: COALESCE is used to replace NULL values with defaults in the final SELECT statement, ensuring data representation clarity.

8. **Set Operators**: Although not directly used, consider expanding on such parts with UNION statements if you wish to merge results from similar structured queries.

This SQL query is complex yet efficient for performance benchmarking and showcases diverse SQL functionalities and techniques.
