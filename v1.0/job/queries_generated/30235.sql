This SQL query generates a complex analysis of movies produced after the year 2000, taking into account their relationships to other movies and the count of actors featured in them, while also pulling in relevant biographical information where available. It uses recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to manage movie hierarchy, outer joins to gather additional related information, and incorporates window and aggregation functions to summarize actor data. The results are limited to the top 10 movies based on casting size and sorted by production year.
