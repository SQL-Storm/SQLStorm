This SQL query incorporates:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE recursively retrieves titles of movies in a hierarchical structure starting from movies produced after 2000.
2. **Outer joins**: Left joins are used to combine data from various tables, including cast information, character names, movie companies, keywords, and person information.
3. **Count and Aggregation**: Usage of `COUNT` and `SUM` aggregates the number of associated companies, keywords, and non-null person information.
4. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is employed to rank movies within the same production year.
5. **Complicated predicates**: The `WHERE` clause filters the hierarchy level and handles nulls appropriately in aggregate functions.
6. **Result set ordering**: Results are ordered by production year and counts, with a specific handling of nulls in the count of keywords. 

This query is designed for performance benchmarking across joined tables with varying cardinalities and relationships.
