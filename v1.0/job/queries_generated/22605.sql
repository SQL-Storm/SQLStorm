This SQL query begins by establishing several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to gather and analyze data regarding movie titles and the actors associated with those titles. Special attention is paid to gathering statistics, such as the average number of movies with notes and tailoring more intricate conditions and corner cases regarding the aggregation and correlation between different tables.

- It uses recursive CTEs to manage potential complexities around TV show seasons and episodes.
- In the `ActorTitleStats` CTE, it performs aggregate calculations on the `cast_info` to gather interesting statistics for actors.
- The `PivotStats` CTE provides calculations that pivot based on specific conditions like the total number of movies.
- The `ActorRankings` CTE ranks the actors based on their average order per movie.
- The final select statement uses a nested subquery to count movies associated with info, making use of `EXISTS` for further filtering to add depth to the data extraction logic.

This query aims not only to gather a large quantity of data, but also to do so in a sophisticated way that highlights programming intelligence and good practices when working with SQL.
