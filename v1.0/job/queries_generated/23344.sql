### Explanation:
1. **CTEs**: The query uses three Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
   - **RankedMovies**: This CTE ranks movies by their titles within each production year, also counting the associated keywords.
   - **TopAkaNames**: This CTE identifies "aka names" that have been associated with more than five cast members, focusing on popular actors/actresses.
   - **CompanyMovies**: This CTE returns movies produced by companies based in the USA, providing their names and types.

2. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: The main SELECT combines results using a FULL OUTER JOIN to capture all relevant movies and names, even if some do not have associated companies.

3. **COALESCE**: This function is used to return 'Unknown' or 'N/A' for any potentially NULL values, ensuring that the output remains informative.

4. **CASE Statement**: Includes a CASE to explicitly show the title rank if available.

5. **Subquery**: The query contains a correlated subquery within the SELECT clause to calculate the average keyword count across all movies, ensuring that complex calculations are available alongside the main results.

6. **Complicated WHERE Clause**: The WHERE clause includes predicates that combine logical conditions for filtering based on production years and keyword counts, showcasing nuanced filtering.

7. **Order of Results**: The final output is ordered by production year, cast count, and company type, creating an insightful and organized report.

8. **LIMIT**: The result set is limited to 50 entries for performance considerations.

This query structure attempts to push the boundaries of SQL complexity while adhering to logical constraints set by the schema provided.
