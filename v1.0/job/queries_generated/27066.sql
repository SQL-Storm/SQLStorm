### Explanation:
1. **CTE `RankedMovies`**: This common table expression aggregates movie data. It counts distinct cast members for each movie, gathers actor names, and collects associated keywords for movies produced since 2000.

2. **CTE `TopMovies`**: A second CTE uses the first to assign a rank to each movie based on the total number of distinct cast members.

3. **Final Selection**: The final query selects the top 10 movies with the highest cast counts, returning the rank, title, production year, total cast, actor names, and keywords, sorted by rank. 

This query benchmarks string processing through aggregation and concatenation of actor names and keywords, showcasing the capability of SQL for handling complex operations related to strings within the context of a film database.
