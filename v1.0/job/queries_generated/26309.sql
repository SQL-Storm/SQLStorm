This elaborate SQL query does the following:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Creates a `MovieDetails` CTE that aggregates data related to movies released after the year 2000, where the actor's name starts with 'A'.
2. **Joins**: It utilizes a combination of INNER JOINs to link the necessary tables to gather titles, actors, roles, and keywords.
3. **Aggregation**: It uses GROUP_CONCAT to collect all keywords associated with each movie into a single string.
4. **Filtering**: It applies filters to focus on more recent movies and specific actor names.
5. **Final Selection**: The main SELECT statement retrieves the aggregated results, ordering them by production year in descending order and the order of appearance (nr_order) in ascending order.
