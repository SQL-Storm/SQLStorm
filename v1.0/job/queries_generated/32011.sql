This SQL query uses various complex constructs, including:
- Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create a hierarchy of movies linked to each other.
- Window functions to rank movies based on their production year and title.
- Aggregate functions to fetch keywords and count distinct companies for each movie.
- Outer joins to gather additional information about cast members.
- Conditional logic to format output based on NULL values and other conditions.
- Grouping and ordering to provide a final, structured output focused on interesting queries for performance benchmarking.
