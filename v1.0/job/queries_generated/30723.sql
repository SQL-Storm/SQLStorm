This SQL query utilizes several advanced features:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) `MovieHierarchy` to explore a hierarchy of movies linked together.
- The `COALESCE` function to handle potential NULL values for years since release.
- Window function `ROW_NUMBER()` computes a rank based on the production year and title.
- `string_agg()` aggregates names of cast members, filtering out NULL values.
- Subqueries to count keywords and complete casts for each movie.
- It maintains an outer join structure and includes filtering in the `HAVING` clause based on cast count, enhancing complexity.
