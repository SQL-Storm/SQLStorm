### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE `MovieHierarchy` is created to traverse movies and their linked relationships in a hierarchical manner. It initially selects movies and then recursively fetches linked movies to build a hierarchy.

2. **Join Operations**: It uses multiple left joins to gather information from several tables:
   - `movie_companies` to get the production companies associated with a movie.
   - `company_name` to get the names of those companies.
   - `movie_info` for movie ratings, applying a subquery on `info_type` to identify rating info types.
   - `movie_keyword` to link keywords associated with the movie.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: The query computes:
   - Average ratings for movies using `COALESCE` to handle nulls.
   - List of production companies using `STRING_AGG` with a default case for unknown companies.
   - List of keywords associated with movies.

4. **Bizarre Predicate**: The use of `(mh.production_year IS NOT NULL OR mh.production_year IS NULL)` adds a peculiar filter that, in practice, has no real effect but demonstrates strange logical conditions.

5. **Grouping and Ordering**: The results are grouped by movie ID, title, production year, and hierarchy level with a specific order based on production year and hierarchy level. 

This showcases advanced SQL structures and peculiar logic constructs, ideal for performance benchmarking and testing various database optimizations.
