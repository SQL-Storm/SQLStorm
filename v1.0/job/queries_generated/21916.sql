### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This CTE constructs a hierarchy of movies by progressively joining cast and roles, allowing us to trace layers of association up to 5 levels deep. It uses a base query to select movies and cast information, and then unifies this with recursive logic to gather deeper associations.

2. **Window Functions**: The main query utilizes `DENSE_RANK()` and `COUNT() OVER()` to generate rankings of movies and to aggregate cast role counts within the same production year dynamically.

3. **Complex Predicate Logic**: In the `WHERE` clause, multiple predicates filter for movies post-2000 featuring actors or actresses, employing `LIKE` for flexible match criteria.

4. **Distinct Movies Union**: The second CTE counts duplicate movie titles across production years, aggregating results to find titles that share names in various years. `HAVING` is employed to enforce that only titles appearing more than once are included.

5. **ORDER BY**: The use of `ORDER BY` ensures that results maintain logical and readable ordering by `production_year` and `title`, followed up by crunching counts of the duplicate checks making them easy to scan.

This SQL query structure combines advanced SQL features to flexibly analyze movie data while encapsulating real-world complexities often found in film databases.
