This is a complex SQL query involving various SQL constructs aimed at performance benchmarking. It uses a recursive CTE to navigate movie hierarchies (e.g., episodes and their parent series), grouping data related to cast members, production years, and alternative names associated with each movie. The use of window functions for ranking, aggregation functions including `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG`, along with intricate joins and conditional logic, provides a comprehensive view of the data landscape across the tables in the Join Order Benchmark schema.
