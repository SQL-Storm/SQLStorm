### Explanation:
- **CTE (`cast_hierarchy`)**: A recursive common table expression is created to build a hierarchy of cast members for each movie. It starts with the primary cast and allows for depth up to 5, characterizing an additional layer as 'Cameo'.
- **Outer Joins**: The main query uses `LEFT JOIN` to include movies with no cast listed (though we only filter out those with zero cast members in the `HAVING` clause).
- **Aggregations**: `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` for counting unique cast member IDs, `ARRAY_AGG` to collect distinct roles played, `AVG` for the average production year, and `STRING_AGG` for combining cast names.
- **Complicated Predicates**: Thereâ€™s a mixed usage of `CASE` inside average to handle possible NULLs in production year and using `FILTER` in the string aggregation to ignore NULL names.
- **HAVING Clause**: Ensures that only movies with at least one cast member and a caste hierarchy level between 1 and 3 are included.
- **Ordering**: The results are sorted first by the total number of unique cast members in descending order, followed by the average production year in ascending order, returning up to 10 results.
