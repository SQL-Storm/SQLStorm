This SQL query is designed to benchmark performance while utilizing a variety of SQL constructs, including:
- Recursive CTE for querying hierarchical data.
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`) for ranking cast members.
- `LEFT JOIN` for combining data from multiple tables including movie information and cast details.
- Grouping and aggregation to summarize cast information.
- Conditional aggregation with CASE statements.
- Use of string functions to aggregate notes.
- Filtering with the HAVING clause to limit results based on computed averages.
