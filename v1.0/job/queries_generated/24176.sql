This SQL query includes the following constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Multiple CTEs used to build a hierarchy of movies and to collect actors and their movie lists.
2. **Window Functions**: `DENSE_RANK()` to rank actors by the number of movies they've appeared in.
3. **LEFT JOINs**: To gather additional information even when some data may not be present.
4. **Correlated Subqueries**: Used to filter movies related to specific actors.
5. **Aggregations**: `COUNT` and `STRING_AGG` to summarize movie casts and associated keywords.
6. **NULL Logic**: Techniques used to handle NULL values, ensuring meaningful replacements.
7. **HAVING Clause**: Filter on grouped results to ensure a minimum number of cast members.
8. **Complicated predicates**: Combined conditions for filtering results based on keywords and actor presence.
9. **Order By and Limit**: Final result sorting and limiting for the top results only.
