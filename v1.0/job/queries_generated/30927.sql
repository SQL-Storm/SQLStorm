### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE constructs a hierarchy of movies starting from a specific kind of title (assumed to be indicated by `kind_id = 2`). The recursion allows for linking movies in a chain (like sequels or series).
  
2. **Outer Joins**: The main query uses `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that all movies from the `MovieHierarchy` CTE are included even if they do not have associated cast members or keywords.

3. **Aggregation and Calculation**:
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT c.person_id)` counts the unique actors in each movie.
   - The `AVG` expression calculates the percentage of female actors as part of the cast, expressed as a percentage.
   - `STRING_AGG` collects notes associated with each movie, concatenating them into a single string for readability.
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT mki.keyword_id)` counts the number of unique keywords associated with each movie.

4. **Filtering and Ordering**: The filtering criteria limit the results to movies produced after 2000, while the results are ordered by production year descending, then by actor count descending.

5. **Limit**: The query restricts the output to the top 100 records for performance benchmarking.

This query makes use of various SQL constructs and could serve as an interesting benchmark to analyze SQL performance across different joins and aggregations in the provided schema.
