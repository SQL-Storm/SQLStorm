### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - The first CTE (`MovieRankings`) aggregates data about movies, their alternative titles, the count of cast members, average lengths of associated info, and collects associated keywords.
   - The second CTE (`TopRankedMovies`) ranks the movies based on the number of cast members and the average length of movie information.

2. **Final Selection**:
   - The main query selects the top 10 movies based on the created rankings and organizes the output neatly.

3. **Key Functions Used**:
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT)` to determine how many unique cast members are associated with each movie.
   - `AVG()` to calculate average lengths of various strings.
   - `STRING_AGG()` to concatenate keywords associated with each movie into a single string.

4. **Order and Filtering**:
   - The rankings allow you to filter down to the top 10 results based on the criteria outlined. 

This query is useful for benchmarking string processing capabilities due to the variety of string manipulations and aggregations involved.
