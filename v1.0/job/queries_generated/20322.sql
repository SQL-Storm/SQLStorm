### Explanation of the Query Components:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **RankedMovies**: This CTE ranks movies by the number of distinct actors per production year.
   - **CompanyDetails**: This gathers company information associated with each movie and consolidates it into comma-separated lists.
   - **KeywordStats**: This captures keyword statistics (count and maximum length) for each movie.

2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - Used in the final selection to fetch company details and keyword statistics, ensuring that all movies from the ranked list are included even if no companies or keywords exist.

3. **COALESCE**: 
   - Utilized to handle NULL values for movies without companiesâ€”providing a default 'No Companies'.

4. **Complex Predicate Logic**: 
   - The final selection filters for movies with the top 3 ranks per production year.

5. **Set Operators and Grouping**: 
   - Implemented through GROUP BY to aggregate company names and keyword statistics.

6. **String Functions**: 
   - `GROUP_CONCAT` is used to concatenate multiple company names into a single string for each movie.

7. **Complicated Ordering**: 
   - The final output orders the results first by production year (descending), then by the number of keywords, with the longest keyword lengths sorted last for aesthetic and analysis purposes.

8. **NULL Logic**: 
   - Incorporated in sorting (with NULLS LAST) for cleaner output in the presence of missing data.

This query design is intended for performance benchmarking by testing complex joins, grouping, and analytic functions while revealing interesting output about top films and their production details.
