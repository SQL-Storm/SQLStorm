This SQL query generates an elaborate performance benchmark on the `Join Order Benchmark` schema, incorporating recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to build a hierarchy of movies linked by associations, while including complex joins to analyze actors and production companies. It uses `COALESCE` for NULL logic expression for actor names, aggregates production companies and keywords, and utilizes window functions through GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to filter results effectively. The results are finally ordered based on production years and actor names leading to a meaningful outcome.
