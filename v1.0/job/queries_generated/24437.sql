### Explanation of Constructs Used:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE creates a recursive hierarchy of movies based on their links, allowing exploration of relationships between movies.
- **Outer joins**: A LEFT JOIN is performed on `movie_keyword` and `keyword` to include movies without keywords.
- **Correlated Subquery**: A subquery is utilized within the predicate to filter on `kind` that does not contain 'documentary'.
- **Window Functions**: Though not explicitly shown, a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function can be added if required for ranking or further analysis.
- **Complex predicates**: The WHERE clause includes various conditions filtering on enums and NULL values.
- **String Expressions**: A string aggregation function (`STRING_AGG`) concatenates keywords associated with each movie.
- **NULL Logic**: COALESCE is used to handle potential NULL values from the hierarchy depth.
- **Complicated HAVING**: The HAVING clause enforces a condition based on the count of distinct keywords, providing a filter on results after grouping.

This query is designed not only to benchmark performance but also to process a complex set of logical operations and join relationships present in the provided schema.
