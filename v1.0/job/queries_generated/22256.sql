This query does multiple things:

1. `RankedMovies` CTE ranks movies by production year with a descending order based on `imdb_index`.
2. `MovieCast` CTE calculates the total number of unique cast members, aggregating their names and counts how many of them have NULL notes.
3. `MoviesWithInfo` CTE compiles the information from the previously created CTEs, adding total cast members and additional movie-related information based on specific conditions.
4. The final SELECT query applies additional calculations to assess the state of cast data and sorts the results in an interesting order while filtering out irrelevant information. 

Using various SQL constructs, this query provides a robust performance benchmark indicating how the schema can be manipulated and queried in a complex environment.
