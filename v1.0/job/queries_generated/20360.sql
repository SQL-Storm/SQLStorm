### Explanation of Query Components:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - **RankedMovies**: This CTE ranks movies based on the count of actors for each production year, enabling us to filter for the top 5 movies per year.
  - **CompanyMovieCounts**: Counts distinct companies associated with each movie.
  - **MovieRatings**: Averages the ratings related to the movies based on certain criteria.

- **Joins**:
  - **LEFT JOIN** is used to retain all movies even if they have missing associations (like no actors, companies or ratings).
  
- **Aggregates**:
  - COUNT and AVG functions determine actor counts and average ratings respectively.

- **Conditional Logic**:
  - CASE statements categorize actor counts and ratings into labeled groups.

- **Predicate Logic**:
  - The WHERE clause includes conditions to filter for movies from the year 2000 onwards and ranks of 5 or less.

- **COALESCE** is incorporated to handle NULL values from left joins for counts and ratings.

### Complexity & Corner Cases:
- The query handles NULL values, various joining scenarios, and aggregates that might not apply to every record, embodying complex SQL semantics while addressing the schema provided.
