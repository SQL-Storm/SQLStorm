### Explanation of the SQL Query

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **`movie_hierarchy`**: A recursive CTE that builds a hierarchy of movies linked through a `movie_link` relationship, focusing on movies produced after the year 2000 and limiting the hierarchy level to 3.
   - **`top_companies`**: Aggregates movie companies to identify those associated with more than 2 movies.
   - **`ranked_movies`**: Counts distinct actors for each movie and ranks them by the number of actors in each production year.

2. **Main SELECT Statement**:
   - Joins the results from `ranked_movies` and `top_companies` to output relevant movie details.
   - Utilizes `COALESCE` to manage NULL values resulting from the left join when no companies are associated with a movie.
   - A case statement to categorize the popularity of movies based on the number of actors.
   - A correlated subquery to get the count of similar titles based on the main movie title.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Use of outer joins and CTEs, combined with aggregate functions, window functions, and string expressions.
   - Consideration for NULL values using `COALESCE` and nested `CASE` statements which reflects intricate logic.
   - Recursive query for a more intricate query structure and potential edge cases with movie links.

This SQL query is tailored for performance benchmarking, emphasizing complex constructs and potentially unusual SQL behaviors.
