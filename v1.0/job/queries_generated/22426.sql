This elaborate SQL query leverages multiple features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), outer joins, window functions, aggregate functions, and complicated predicates. 

1. **Recursive CTE**: The first CTE, `RecursiveMovieData`, fetches movies with their respective keywords and counts how many companies associated with each movie.

2. **Union & Aggregation**: The second part of the CTE unifies the data by allowing the system to also display a representation for movies with more than 3 distinct cast members, providing a mix of regular and aggregated data.

3. **Subquery**: The second CTE, `MovieInfo`, joins the previously defined CTE with additional information pulled from `movie_info`, showcasing a complex join relationship.

4. **String Operations**: String manipulation is demonstrated via trimming unnecessary whitespaces from the sampled information.

5. **Conditional Logic**: There is also a CASE statement that classifies movies based on the number of associated companies.

The query is designed for performance benchmarking, exploring the potential optimizations that can be applied on various joins and computations around the movie data, and bringing in some interesting semantic challenges around filtering and aggregation.
