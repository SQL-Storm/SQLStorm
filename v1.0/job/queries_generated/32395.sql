This SQL query showcases various complex SQL constructs:

- It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, with a depth limitation.
- Joins numerous tables to aggregate movie-related details including cast counts and associated keywords.
- Incorporates window functions (`COUNT` and `AVG`) to derive additional insights from the dataset.
- Utilizes string aggregation to compile actor names into one column.
- Implements grouping and filtering with the HAVING clause to focus on movies with a substantial cast size, ensuring only relevant records are returned.
- It contains multiple LEFT JOINs demonstrating handling of NULL data effectively with `COALESCE`. 

All of these elements work together to perform an elaborate performance benchmark while efficiently retrieving complex relationships within the movie database schema.
