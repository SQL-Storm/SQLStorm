This SQL query generates a performance benchmark by analyzing titles from the `aka_title` table that have a cast count, includes various JOIN types, CTEs, window functions, aggregation, and corner cases considering NULL values and filtering conditions. It seeks to display the titles released after the year 2000 and the unique actors associated with them, while also showcasing the complexities of the schema relationships and the ability to handle peculiar SQL semantics.
