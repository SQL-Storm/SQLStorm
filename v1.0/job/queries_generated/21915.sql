This SQL query performs the following functions:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: The query defines several CTEs to break down the logic of the query and enhance readability.
   - `RankedMovies`: This CTE retrieves movie titles by joining `aka_title` and `cast_info`, calculating the total cast for each title and a rank based on the total count of cast members per production year.
   - `MovieWithInfo`: Adds additional information about the movies based on criteria for era and handles missing information elegantly with `COALESCE`.
   - `TopMovies`: Filters the top movies per year with the most cast members and provides an overall rank.
   
2. **LEFT JOINs for Additional Data**: The main query joins `TopMovies` with relevant tables to fetch keywords for each movie while handling cases where keywords might not exist.

3. **Complicated Predicates/Expressions**: The query incorporates various conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on production year and checks for NULL values.

4. **CASE Statements**: These are used to create a derived column 'era' and to handle keywords, providing a fallback value when a keyword does not exist.

5. **Ordering**: The final result is ordered by overall rank and total cast, making it easier to identify the most notable films based on the casting ensemble. 

This query can be used for performance benchmarking due to its complexity and reliance on multiple SQL constructs.
