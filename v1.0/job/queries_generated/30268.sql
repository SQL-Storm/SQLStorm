### Explanation:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The query starts with a recursive CTE named `MovieHierarchy` that identifies all movies produced from the year 2000 onward, and recursively pulls linked movies to create a hierarchy based on linkage.

2. **SELECT Statement**: The query retrieves distinct actors, along with their associated movie details, including the movieâ€™s hierarchical level.

3. **Joins**:
   - `aka_name` (for actor names) is joined with `cast_info` (to link actors to movies).
   - The CTE `MovieHierarchy` links current movies and their relationships.
   - `aka_title` retrieves the titles of the movies.
   - Left joins with `movie_keyword` and `keyword` allow for the inclusion of movie keywords, using conditions to filter out unwanted keywords.

4. **WHERE Clauses**: Filters are applied to ensure names are not NULL or empty, and restricts the production years to greater than or equal to 2000. Additionally, it excludes movies labeled with the keyword "horror".

5. **Window Function**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is utilized to rank movies for each actor based on the production year in descending order.

6. **Order By**: Results are ordered first by `person_id` and then by `production_year` for better readability. 

This query demonstrates various complex SQL constructs while providing a comprehensive view of the movie hierarchy and actor participation over the years.
