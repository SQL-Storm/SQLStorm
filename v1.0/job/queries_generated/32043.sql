Explanation:
1. This query creates a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) called `MovieHierarchy` to build a hierarchy of movies linked together (through the `movie_link` table).
2. It starts by selecting movies from the `aka_title` table produced after the year 2000.
3. The UNION ALL allows it to retrieve linked movies recursively.
4. The main SELECT statement aggregates information about actors, their roles, and associated keywords.
5. It includes multiple join conditions and applies a LEFT JOIN to get movie titles.
6. An array aggregate collects notes from `cast_info` for the actorâ€™s roles.
7. A filtering clause (HAVING) ensures that only actors with more than one role are included.
8. Finally, it orders the results by release year and actor name.
