This SQL query breaks down into several parts:

1. **ranked_titles**: This CTE (common table expression) ranks movie titles by production year and title.
2. **person_roles**: This CTE collects information about the roles taken by each person in the cast, aggregating them and counting the number of roles.
3. **company_movie_info**: This CTE aggregates company information for each movie, including a count of keywords associated with the movie.
4. **final_report**: This final CTE combines all previous CTEs to produce a comprehensive report with titles, their production years, cast roles, associated companies, and keyword counts.
5. In the final selection, filtering is based on names that contain 'Smith', demonstrating string processing while also incorporating joins across multiple tables.

This intricate SQL query is designed for benchmarking string processing capabilities in conjunction with multiple joins and aggregations.
