### Explanation:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: A recursive CTE named `movie_hierarchy` is created to retrieve the movies starting from the year 2000 and their linked counterparts through `movie_link`. The level hierarchy reflects the depth of linked relationships.

2. **Main Query**: The main query selects actor names and their associated movies from the `aka_name` and `cast_info` tables, filtering on the hierarchical movies from the CTE.

3. **Left Joins**: Used on `movie_hierarchy` and `movie_keyword` to include details about movies even when some might not have corresponding keywords.

4. **Aggregations**: The query counts distinct keywords associated with each movie and concatenates them into a string.

5. **Row Number Window Function**: This assigns a rank to each actor's movies based on the release year, partitioned by actor names.

6. **Filtering with HAVING**: The results are filtered to include only actors and movies with more than 2 distinct keywords or where thereâ€™s at least one NULL keyword in the list.

7. **Ordering**: Finally, results are ordered by actor name and production year to provide a clear structure in the output.
