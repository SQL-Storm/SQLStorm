This query showcases a rich set of SQL constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and various JOIN types. It demonstrates an intricate benchmarking of movie titles by distinguishing by their respective kinds, counting associated cast members, aggregating relevant movie information into a single string, and fetching highly rated movies based on external criteria, all while cleverly integrating various forms of NULL handling and complex conditions.
