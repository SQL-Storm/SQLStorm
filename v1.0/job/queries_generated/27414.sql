This SQL query accomplishes the following:
1. It defines several common table expressions (CTEs) to generate intermediate data, focusing on movies produced after 2000.
2. It ranks movies based on their total number of cast members and aggregates associated keywords and names.
3. It also identifies actors who have participated in more than five movies.
4. Finally, it produces a result set showcasing detailed information about the top-ranked movies alongside the names of relevant actors, with a limit of 100 results.
