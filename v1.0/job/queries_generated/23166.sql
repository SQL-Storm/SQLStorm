### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **RankedMovies**: This CTE ranks movies by production year and counts the associated cast members. It returns movies with their production year and cast count.
   - **TopMovies**: Filters the ranked movies to get the top 5 movies per production year.
   - **MovieKeywords**: This CTE retrieves keywords associated with movies.

2. **Main SELECT Statement**:
   - Joins the top movies with their keywords, ensuring to retrieve only those movies with casts.
   - Uses subqueries to get the unique cast count for each movie.
   - Displays ` production_year_display`, which shows a default value if the year equals 2000, using `NULLIF` to check for NULL values.

3. **Aggregations**:
   - Uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords into a single string for each movie.
   
4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Filters movies with at least one cast member (`tm.cast_count > 0`) and orders the result by production year descending and cast count descending.

5. **Fetch Limiting**:
   - Limits the results to the first 10 rows for performance benchmarking. 

This intricate SQL query illustrates multiple advanced SQL features and effectively addresses performance while dealing with various constructs such as joins, aggregates, window functions, and subqueries.
