This SQL query performs the following operations:

1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: Constructs a hierarchy of movies from the year 2000 onwards, allowing for connections between movies through links.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `movie_hierarchy`, and `aka_title` to gather actor names, the titles of their movies, their roles, and additional person info.
   - Applies outer join logic with `LEFT JOIN` to include cases where there's no recorded role or additional information.
   - Uses `COALESCE` to substitute a placeholder for roles that are NULL.
   - Utilizes window functions to count total movies per actor and assign a rank based on production year.

3. **Filtering**: Ensures that the filtered results only include actors associated with movies while checking that their production year is valid.

4. **Ordering**: Finally orders the results by total movies acted in, and by actor name for organized output. 

This query is complex and showcases various SQL constructs including CTEs, joins, aggregate functions, and window functions.
