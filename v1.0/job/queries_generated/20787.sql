### Explanation:

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - `ranked_movies`: This CTE ranks movies by the number of cast members for each production year, selecting only those with a specific 'kind' (`kind_id IN (1, 2)`).
  - `distinct_names`: This CTE pulls distinct names of people from the `aka_name` table, ensuring that we handle potential NULL values and exclude empty names.
  - `movie_name_counts`: This CTE counts the distinct names associated with each movie from the `movie_info` table, establishing a link to the previously filtered distinct names.

- **Main Query**:
  - Joins the ranked movies with the unique name counts and associated cast information.
  - Uses `CASE` statement to handle NULL logic effectively and converts counts to text when necessary.
  - Uses `STRING_AGG` to collect cast notes into a single string, providing context for each movie in the result.

- **Window Functions**:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank the movies within each production year.
  - `DENSE_RANK()` to provide a ranking of the top movies.

- **Filters and Aggregation**:
  - Filters the main query's results to include only the top 5 ranked movies per year, groups by essential fields, and orders by production year and rank.

This SQL query demonstrates advanced SQL features, including CTEs, window functions, outer joins, and complex aggregation techniques, showcasing various SQL capabilities in the context of benchmarking movie data.
