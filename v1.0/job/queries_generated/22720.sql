### Explanation of Key Elements:
1. **CTEs**: The query contains two Common Table Expressions (CTEs). The first (`MovieHierarchy`) builds a recursive structure of movies and their linked counterparts. It selects movies after the year 2000. The second CTE (`RankedMovies`) ranks the movies and counts the total links for each production year.

2. **Correlated Subqueries**: We're using window functions to rank the movies by production year and level.

3. **Outer Joins**: The final query employs LEFT JOINs to gather additional information regarding keywords, cast information (roles), and names, ensuring we capture all relevant records, even if there are missing links.

4. **Aggregations and Filters**: The `STRING_AGG` function compiles a list of actor names related to each movie. The `COUNT` function counts the roles with appropriate filters.

5. **Unusual Logic**: The HAVING clause includes an unusual condition to filter movies based on levels, allowing for quirky resultsâ€”movies with more complex nested links. 

6. **NULL Handling**: The COALESCE function ensures that if no keyword exists, it will return 'No keyword', demonstrating handling of NULL values.

7. **Order By**: The ordering is structured to show the most recent movies first, followed by their rankings. 

This query is designed for performance benchmarking to test the database's ability to handle complex queries that involve recursion, aggregation, and multi-table joins, while also showcasing interesting SQL behaviors.
