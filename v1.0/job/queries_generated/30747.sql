This SQL query is designed for performance benchmarking, featuring the following constructs:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to explore a hierarchy of movies and their links.
- An outer join to gather movie keywords and company types.
- Window functions to count actors per movie and facilitate sorting.
- A filter with group functions and complicated predicates to aggregate results.
- String aggregation for movie keywords, demonstrating string manipulation and handling NULL values.
- An explicit case statement for providing a fallback for NULL production years. 

The structure emphasizes relationships among tables while keeping the query intricate and performance-oriented for potential benchmarking scenarios.
