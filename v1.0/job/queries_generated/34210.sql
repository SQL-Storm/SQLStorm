This SQL query performs an analysis on actors and movies from 2000 to 2020, utilizing a recursive CTE to build a movie hierarchy for linked films, employing window functions to calculate aggregates like average production years and distinct keyword counts, and filtering based on various conditions, including NULL checks and relevance criteria. It can serve as a performance benchmark for various SQL constructs and optimization strategies.
