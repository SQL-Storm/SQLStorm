This SQL query utilizes several advanced SQL concepts:
- **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: To create a hierarchy of movies linked together through recursive relationships.
- **Outer joins**: To include movies even if there are no entries in related tables (e.g., `complete_cast` and `movie_keyword`).
- **Aggregations and window functions**: To calculate counts and averages.
- **String aggregation**: To compile keywords into a single field.
- **Complex WHERE conditions**: Applying filters that involve NULL logic and calculations.
- **GROUP BY and HAVING**: To summarize and filter results based on aggregation results. 

This query is designed for performance benchmarking purposes, displaying how complex SQL operations can interact and yield comprehensive data results.
