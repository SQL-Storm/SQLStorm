This SQL query performs an elaborate benchmarking assessment on a movie database. It constructs a recursive CTE to create a hierarchy of movies produced after the year 2000, includes multiple outer joins to gather additional details, employs aggregate functions to count different data points, utilizes `STRING_AGG` to gather keywords, and uses HAVING and complex predicates to filter the results.
