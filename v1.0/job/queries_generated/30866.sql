**Explanation of SQL Query Constructs Used:**

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `ActorHierarchy` CTE is constructed to find actors in a related movie chain, starting from a specific title and expanding to any linked movies.

2. **Subqueries**: There are numerous subqueries used to fetch minimum and maximum production years for the average age calculation and to find movie IDs.

3. **String Aggregation**: The `STRING_AGG` function is used to compile a list of unique keywords associated with each actor's movies.

4. **Outer Join**: A `LEFT JOIN` is utilized to include actors with no associated keywords without excluding them from the results.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The `HAVING` clause filters actors based on having acted in more than 5 movies, adding a threshold to the results.

6. **Window Functions**: Itâ€™s not used in this specific example but could be employed if you wanted to incorporate running totals or ranks.

7. **Date Difference Calculation**: The `TIMESTAMPDIFF` function is utilized to calculate the age of movies, which enhances the information being reported.

This query is designed to be both complex and informative, suitable for benchmarking the performance of various SQL constructs and underlying database schema operations.
