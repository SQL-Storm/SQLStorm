This SQL query utilizes multiple advanced constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The `movie_hierarchy` CTE retrieves all movies produced after the year 2000 and their linked movies recursively.
   
2. **Joins**: It performs various joins to gather data from `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `movie_hierarchy`, and others.

3. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is applied to rank movies for each actor based on the production year.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**: The query aggregates the results by actor and movie to count distinct keywords and movie info types.

5. **Having Clause**: A conditional filter is added to ensure only those actors with more than two distinct keywords for movies are retained.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause includes checks for NULL and empty strings.

7. **Order and Limits**: The final results are ordered by the actor's movie rank and the production year, limited to 50 results for efficiency.

This pattern helps benchmark performance due to its complexity in data retrieval, aggregation, and various joined datasets.
