This query benchmarks string processing by aggregating and concatenating string data using SQL's `STRING_AGG` function, while also demonstrating complex joining operations and window functions. It identifies the top 5 latest movies of each kind, counts the number of associated companies and keywords, and combines that with the names of directors associated with each film. The result is ordered by production year, followed by the number of associated companies and keywords for insightful benchmarking.
