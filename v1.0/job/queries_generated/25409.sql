This SQL query will produce a list of the top 10 movies by the total number of cast members. It includes details about the movie title, production year, total cast count, associated keywords, and the types of companies involved in the movie. The use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) helps in maintaining readability while achieving elaborate string processing and aggregation.
