This SQL query is structured to fetch performance benchmarks about movies from the provided schema by combining various advanced SQL constructs:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Used to build layers to derive movie hierarchies, keyword information, and actor role details.
2. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is utilized to rank linked movies and actors within their respective contexts.
3. **Set Operators and Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG` for concatenating keywords, `ARRAY_AGG` for creating a list of actors with their roles and counts.
4. **NULL Logic**: Handling counts of NULL notes and integrating them into the final selection criteria.
5. **Complex Predicates and Filtering**: The final selection incorporates conditions for years and null logic considerators. 
6. **Correlated Subqueries**: The movie hierarchy expansion shows how recursive relationships can be navigated.

This comprehensive query is designed to test the capabilities of the database system and examine performance in processing complex query structures over the movie dataset.
