-- Hereâ€™s a summary of what this query does:
-- 1. It defines a recursive CTE `movie_hierarchy` to get films and episodes in a hierarchical structure.
-- 2. It retrieves actors associated with each movie/episode, along with the movie title and type.
-- 3. Counts total distinct actors per movie, with a string concatenation of associated keywords, filtered by title containing "adventure".
-- 4. Finally, results are ordered by movie ID and the total number of actors, placing NULLs last.
