This SQL query accomplishes the following:
- It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to recursively find connections between movies and their related companies, keywords, and cast members.
- It includes complex joins such as left joins to bring in data from multiple related tables.
- It applies aggregation functions to compile a summary of companies and keywords associated with each movie.
- It utilizes a window function to rank movies based on the size of their cast and the average info type ID.
- It categorizes movies based on the size of their cast into 'Large Cast', 'Medium Cast', and 'Small Cast'.
- Finally, it selects the top 10 ranked movies to provide a performance benchmark.
