In this query, we create a recursive CTE called `movie_hierarchy` to explore the connections between linked movies produced between 2000 and 2010. We then join this CTE with multiple tables to gather information about actors, movies, and relevant person information, including handling nulls with COALESCE, and applying complex predicates in the WHERE and HAVING clauses. The results are grouped appropriately to provide insights on actor names and their associated movie titles, including additional attributes about their birth and death dates while counting the number of linked movies and determining the maximum depth of the movie hierarchy.
