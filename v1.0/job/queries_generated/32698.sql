This SQL query performs the following functions:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `movie_hierarchy` CTE constructs a hierarchy of movies and episodes, starting from top-level movies without a season number and diving into their corresponding episodes. 

2. **Various Joins**: The main query joins the cast information and movie hierarchy, combines it with keywords associated with each movie, and gathers companies associated with the films.

3. **Window Function**: It uses a window function to calculate how many different movies a particular cast member has appeared in.

4. **String Aggregation**: It aggregates all keywords related to each movie into a single text string.

5. **NULL Logic**: It filters out NULL and empty strings for names and keywords to ensure meaningful results.

6. **Complex Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters for movies produced in 2000 or later. 

7. **Grouping and Ordering**: The results are grouped by cast member and movie title and ordered by production year and the count of movies, making it easy to identify prominent actors or actresses in recent films. 

This elaborate and interlinked query is ideal for performance benchmarking, showcasing various SQL constructs.
