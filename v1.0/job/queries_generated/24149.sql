In this elaborate SQL query, we explore several features of SQL including:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: We use three CTEs (`RankedMovies`, `FilteredMovies`, and `AggregateRoles`) to break down the query into manageable pieces for better readability and structure.

2. **Window Functions**: We utilize `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking movies based on their production year and title within the `RankedMovies` CTE. We also employ `COUNT()` and `MAX()` as window functions to gather information about keywords and roles.

3. **Outer Joins**: Several `LEFT JOIN` clauses are used, particularly with movie and company tables, allowing the query to gather relevant data even if there are missing relationships.

4. **Complex Predicate Logic**: We filter records in `FilteredMovies` on multiple conditions: ensuring valid production years, limiting ranks, and checking that there are keywords and valid roles.

5. **Aggregate Functions**: In the `AggregateRoles` CTE, we count distinct actors and aggregate company names for each movie.

6. **String Aggregation**: The `STRING_AGG` function is used to combine company names into a single string.

7. **NULL Handling**: We handle potential NULL values with `COALESCE()` to ensure comparisons are valid.

8. **Conditional Logic**: A `CASE` statement divides movies based on actor count into descriptive categories.

This query would facilitate performance benchmarking by evaluating how well the database engine processes complex querying logic and joins across numerous tables, while also returning meaningful summarized data.
