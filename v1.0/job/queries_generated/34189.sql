This SQL query uses various constructs including a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to form a movie hierarchy, outer joins to gather related data from different tables including production companies and movie keywords, group by to summarize the data, and window functions to compute averages and counts. The query is designed to give insights into movies produced from the year 2000 onwards, including the count of production companies, average keywords used, and the maximum hierarchy level of linked movies, all while filtering and ordering the result set for the top 50 movies based on criteria provided.
