### Explanation:

1. **Recursive CTE**: This constructs a hierarchical tree of movies and their episodes by leveraging recursion, where the base case selects movies that are not episodes while the recursive part links episodes back to their parent titles.

2. **COALESCE and NULLIF**: Ensures that if the title is NULL or an empty string, it defaults to 'N/A', demostrating NULL logic with a combination of string expressions.

3. **Window Function**: `COUNT(DISTINCT ci.person_id) OVER (PARTITION BY mh.movie_id)` calculates the number of distinct actors per movie, a common requirement in performance benchmarking.

4. **STRING_AGG**: This aggregates actor names into a comma-separated string for cleaner results presentation, showcasing the ability to combine results.

5. **Complex JOIN Logic**: The query includes multiple outer joins. It connects movies with their cast and uses conditions on the 'info_type' table to gather specific information about each movie.

6. **Complicated Filtering**: Filtering based on production year, and using a subquery in the WHERE clause to filter based on condition ensuring it selects only non-short films.

7. **Pagination**: Limiting results to the first 50 entries after sorting, which benchmarks retrieval performance while limiting data fetch in typical use cases.

8. **Order By with Depth**: Result sorting not just by year but also structured to consider depth of relationship in the hierarchy shows complexity in result ordering.

Each of these constructs contributes to the richness and complexity of the SQL query while providing good variance and insight into the data across associated tables.
