This SQL query uses various SQL constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, aggregations, and conditional expressions to create a comprehensive performance benchmarking report. The first part analyzes actor performance based on movie counts and ratings, while the second part explores more obscure aggregates, including character lengths and NULL handling with string functions.
