This elaborate SQL query includes several advanced concepts such as:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the query and break it down into manageable parts.
- Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `COUNT()` to rank movies and count distinct casts.
- A filtered selection of movies based on their titles and production years.
- An aggregation using `STRING_AGG()` to concatenate keywords for each movie.
- Use of `COALESCE` to handle potential `NULL` values in keyword aggregation.
- A `UNION ALL` to combine the results of ranked movies with a summary row that shows the total cast count when applicable.
- A `CASE` statement to categorize movies based on their production year.
- NULL logic incorporated in the ordering.

This query effectively combines various SQL features to showcase complex relationships in the data while also handling corner cases and NULL logic in an interesting way.
