This SQL query generates a performance benchmark by leveraging recursive CTEs to create a hierarchical relationship among movies, aggregated cast information, and analyzing keywords associated with each movie. It includes elaborate constructs like outer joins, correlated subqueries, window functions, and NULL logic to handle potential data gaps. The outer query compiles the results into a structured output that shows the status of the keywords and cast information for each movie.
