### Explanation of Constructs Used:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `movie_hierarchy` is used to recursively gather data about movie links, creating a hierarchy starting from movies with a defined production year.

2. **Outer Joins**: Leverage `LEFT JOIN` for potential relationships with production companies and keywords to include all necessary details even if some relationships are missing.

3. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to rank movies based on their production year for each actor, which helps in organizing the output.

4. **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` is used to calculate unique counts of production companies and keywords, and `STRING_AGG` is used to compile a list of keywords for each movie.

5. **Case Expressions**: Used to determine the predominant gender of actors, ensuring it defaults to 'Male' when thereâ€™s no female gender entry.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: Filters include non-null names, production year checks, and company conditions that involve both `NULL` checks and conditions on the `note` column.

7. **Set Operators**: A subquery within the WHERE clause is used to exclude certain `kind_id` entries from the filtering.

8. **NULL Logic**: Used in `HAVING` to ensure results only include actors who have worked in movies with associated production companies.

9. **Pagination**: The `OFFSET` and `FETCH` clauses are employed to paginate the results, limiting output for performance benchmarking. 

This query is intricate and highlights a mix of SQL features while adhering to the schema provided.
