This SQL query leverages various constructs, including a recursive common table expression (CTE) for traversing a hierarchy of movies, left joins to pull in related data from various tables (casts, companies, keywords, and person information), window functions for aggregate counts, conditionals for calculating averages, and robust grouping and filtering. It aims to benchmark the performance of querying hierarchical movie data, focusing on movies produced after 2000 with specific attributes.
