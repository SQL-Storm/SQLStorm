This query incorporates various SQL constructs:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for organizing the data with clear intent.
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER` and `COUNT` with `OVER`) to rank titles and calculate counts separately for each actor.
- Left joins to include all actors even if they don't have associated keywords.
- Conditional aggregation with `SUM` and `COUNT` to determine different statistics for actors.
- A variety of case statements to classify actors based on their movie count and track the presence of keywords.
- The usage of `COALESCE` to handle NULLs when checking for keyword counts.

This query showcases a combination of analytical processing and intricate correlations, pushing the limits of complex SQL while ensuring it still produces meaningful results.
