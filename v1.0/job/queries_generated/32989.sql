This SQL query achieves several interesting outcomes:

1. **Recursive CTE** (`movie_hierarchy`): It builds a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, starting from movies released post-2000.

2. **Aggregate Functions**: It counts total cast members per movie and averages the production years for companies involved in movie production.

3. **String Aggregation**: It concatenates all distinct company types associated with each title into a single string.

4. **Window Functions**: It ranks actors by the production year of the movies they participated in to get the latest roles for each actor.

5. **Left Joins and Null Handling**: It handles cases where a movie might not have associated companies or information gracefully, ensuring that the results still reflect those situations without errors.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: It uses filters and subqueries to create a robust filtering mechanism for movie production years.

Overall, this query showcases powerful SQL capabilities and aims to provide meaningful insight into actors' roles and the context of the movies they are associated with.
