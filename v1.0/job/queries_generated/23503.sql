### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **RankedMovies**: Retrieves movie titles and their production years along with a rank based on their IDs for each production year.
   - **ActorCounts**: Counts distinct actors in the `cast_info` table for each movie.
   - **CommentedMovies**: Retrieves movie comments from the `movie_info` table with a fallback for missing comments.
  
2. **Complex Logic and Joins**:
   - The final selection combines the results from multiple CTEs using outer joins, ensuring all top-ranked movies are retrieved even if they donâ€™t have actors or comments.
   
3. **Use of COALESCE**: It is used to handle any NULL comments to ensure there is a standard response when comments are not available.

4. **Complex Predicate Logic**: The final `WHERE` clause filters for movies only produced after the year 2000 and limits the results to the top three movies per production year.

5. **Window Functions**: RANK() is used to establish priorities among the movies for each year based on their IDs.

6. **String Expressions**: CONCAT is used to generate a detailed status message regarding the number of actors.

7. **NULL Logic**: Thoroughly handles NULL cases for both actor counts and comments, ensuring meaningful outputs.

This query aims to yield insights on recent top movies along with their actor lists, comments, and fallback responses for entries lacking complete data.
