### Explanation:
- The query employs several advanced SQL constructs:
  - **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are used to create a temporary result set for ranked movies, top movies, and to gather movie details.
  - **Window functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()` rank movies by their production year and title within the `RankedMovies` CTE.
  - **LEFT JOINs** are used for nullable fields ensuring that we maintain the left data even when corresponding records donâ€™t exist.
  - **COALESCE** and **NULLIF** functions are utilized to provide fallback values and handle NULL entries gracefully.
  - The use of **STRING_AGG** helps in aggregating keywords into a comma-separated list.
  - The query finalizes the data selection with conditional logic using a `CASE` statement to determine the status of the actors.
- The final select is also limited to provide pagination, fetching the top 10 records based on specified criteria.
