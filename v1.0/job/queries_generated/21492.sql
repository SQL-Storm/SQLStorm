This query accomplishes the following:

1. **CTE for Hierarchical Data**: The Common Table Expression (`movie_hierarchy`) builds a recursive relationship between movies and their linked counterparts, allowing for a depth of 5 movie relationships.

2. **Join Multiple Tables**: It retrieves the actors associated with movies, their titles, production years, and the count of distinct companies involved in production, incorporating several tables.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: The query counts how many companies worked on each movie and uses `SUM` to find out how many of those companies have NULL notes.

4. **String Aggregation with Filtering**: `STRING_AGG` collects keywords associated with each movie, while filtering out any potential NULL values.

5. **Window Function for Ranking**: The use of the `RANK()` window function orders results based on company counts within each production year.

6. **Complicated Conditions**: The `HAVING` clause sets a condition to include only movies that involve more than two companies, adding complexity to the logic.

7. **Distinct and Unique Value Extraction**: It incorporates `DISTINCT` in aggregations to ensure unique counts and keyword aggregations.

8. **Ordering and Limiting Results**: Finally, the result set is ordered by production year and the computed rank, limiting the output to the top 10 results. 

This comprehensive query effectively benchmarks SQL performance through its complexity and reliance on various SQL constructs while producing meaningful results from the provided schema.
