This SQL query includes various advanced constructs for a performance benchmarking context:

1. **Recursive CTE (ActorHierarchy)**: Builds a hierarchy of actors over movies produced from the year 2000 onwards.
2. **Aggregate Functions**: It computes minimum and maximum production years and counts distinct movie occurrences.
3. **String Aggregation**: Collects a list of distinct movie titles associated with each actor.
4. **Window Functions**: Uses `LEAD` to get the name of the next actor (based on alphabetical order).
5. **Complex Calculations**: Constructs the average age difference from the production year to the current date but handles NULL logic gracefully with `NULLIF`.
6. **Conditional Aggregation**: Counts titles that have a specified kind using a CASE statement.
7. **HAVING Clause**: Filters to include only actors with more than 5 movies, ensuring a focus on prolific actors.

This comprehensive query is geared towards evaluating the performance and complexity of interactions in the entertainment domain using the provided schema.
