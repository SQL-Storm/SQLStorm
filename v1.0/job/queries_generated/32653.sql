This SQL query performs an elaborate selection by combining several advanced SQL concepts, including recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to handle movie hierarchies, outer joins to bring in relevant information, window functions for aggregating the count of actors, as well as COALESCE and conditional aggregation to count noted roles appropriately. It ensures performance benchmarking by filtering movies produced after the year 2000, while also presenting actors and their correlating movie titles effectively.
