This query does the following:
1. It begins with a recursive common table expression (CTE) named `MovieHierarchy`, which builds a hierarchy of movies and episodes.
2. A second CTE, `ActorStats`, aggregates data about actors, counting their movies and averaging the production years of those movies.
3. A third CTE, `MovieKeywords`, collects keywords associated with each movie.
4. Finally, it combines the results from these CTEs to produce a comprehensive report that lists the episodes along with their keywords, actors' names, movie counts, and the average production year for movies the actors are in, filtering for top-level episodes and preparing for display. 

The use of outer joins, aggregate functions, and recursive structures creates an intricate analysis for performance benchmarking.
