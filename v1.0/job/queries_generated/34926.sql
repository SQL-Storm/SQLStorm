This SQL query performs performance benchmarking on movie actors based on their participation in films from 2000 onwards, accentuating the companies involved in those movies and the hierarchy of linked titles. It incorporates concepts like recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, aggregate functions, outer joins, and complex filtering to provide a nuanced overview of actor collaborations and movie production contexts.
