This SQL query employs complex constructs to provide a performance benchmark of movies and series from the dataset. It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) called `MovieSeries` to gather information about movies and their related episodes, aggregates cast information, and captures relevant details. The outer query presents the movie's title, production year, cast count, cast names, keywords, cast status, and movie type, while managing NULL values and using various SQL functionalities.
