This SQL query aims to benchmark string processing by identifying movies with a high cast count, while also aggregating keywords associated with them. It consists of several CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to break down complex data processing into manageable parts:

1. **ranked_movies**: This CTE calculates the number of casts for each movie.
2. **high_cast_movies**: This filters the movies that have more than five casts and ranks them based on the cast count.
3. **movie_keywords**: This aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a single string to provide a comprehensive view of each film's thematic elements.

Finally, the main query retrieves the top 10 movies with the most casts, along with their keywords, ordered by the number of casts and then by the production year. This structure allows for effective string processing through the use of `STRING_AGG` and ranks data with ranking functions.
