### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedTitles`: Ranks movies for each actor by production year, focusing on their latest 5 films.
   - `HistoricalTitles`: Filters the ranked titles to include only the latest 5 for each actor.
   - `RecentMovies`: Gathers titles from 2020 onwards along with the count of associated keywords.
   - `ActorPerformance`: Calculates the count of active titles, average rank, and aggregates featured movies for each actor.

2. **Outer Joins**: Uses `LEFT JOIN` to include actors without any associated recent movies.

3. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to rank the movies produced by each actor.

4. **Correlated Subqueries**: In the `WHERE` clause of `ActorPerformance`, checks against the average title rank and keywords.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: Involve several layers of aggregation and filtering based on conditions and calculations on the fly.

6. **String Expressions**: Using `STRING_AGG` to concatenate movie titles into a single string.

7. **NULL Logic**: Uses `COALESCE` to handle cases where there might be no recent keywords or titles produced.

8. **Set Operators**: Although not explicitly included, can be easily added with UNION or INTERSECT for more complex queries.

9. **Order and Limits**: Specify an ordering of results based on keyword counts and average title rank, combined with pagination using OFFSET.

This query structure not only probes into actors' performance and movie attributes but introduces edge cases such as using keyword counts and non-matching titles with the `ILIKE` operator, enhancing the complexity for performance benchmarks.
