This SQL query employs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `RankedMovies` identifies movies along with their ranks based on production year.
   - `ActorRoleCounts` counts distinct roles for actors in movies.
   - `FilteredActors` filters out actors with more than three roles.
   - `MovieDetails` collects the movie details, prominent actor, and keyword count.

2. **Outer Joins**: Used to relate filtered actors and movie keywords, while allowing for movies without prominent actors or keywords.

3. **Correlated Subquery**: The `COALESCE` function checks for the absence of keywords, fetching keywords conditionally.

4. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` helps in ranking movies within their production year.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: Filter criteria involving role counts and keyword counts drive the output.

6. **Set Operators and String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG` concatenates keywords into a single string for better readability.

7. **Bizarre Semantics**: The "(No prominent actor found)" string shows handling of potential NULL logic.

8. **Complex Case Statements**: Generates meaningful categorization of the keyword statuses based on counts.

Overall, this query presents a sophisticated approach to performance benchmarking using the Join Order Benchmark schema while handling edge cases and NULL logic effectively.
