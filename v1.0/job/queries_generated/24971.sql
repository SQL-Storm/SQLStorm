In this SQL query:
- We use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure our query logically.
- The first CTE (MovieCTE) aggregates movie titles with their respective cast counts.
- The second CTE (TitleKeyword) collects keywords associated with each movie.
- The third CTE (CompletedCasts) counts completed casts.
- The fourth CTE (EnhancedMovieData) prepares a final dataset that includes completion status and other derived metrics.
- String aggregation and conditional logic are leveraged to create user-friendly output.
- The output is filtered for completed movies and sorted in terms of production year and cast count. 
- We also apply bizarre semantics through peculiar string operations and NULL handling for movies without casts.
