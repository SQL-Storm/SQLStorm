### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) is used to create a hierarchy of linked movies starting from those produced in or after 2000. This incorporates recursive relations up to 3 levels.

2. **Joins**: Multiple outer joins are applied to gather necessary information across different tables.
   - `JOIN` on `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and `aka_title` to get actor names and the titles of movies they are associated with.
   - `LEFT JOIN` on `movie_keyword` and `keyword` to gather all related keywords for the movies.

3. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is utilized to assign a rank to each actorâ€™s appearances based on their order in the cast for the movie.

4. **Aggregations**: `COUNT(DISTINCT mw.movie_id)` lets you count the unique movies associated with each actor. `STRING_AGG()` aggregates unique keywords into a single string.

5. **Filters**: 
   - `HAVING` clause is used to ensure only actors with more than 5 unique movie appearances are considered.
   - Adjustments in the `WHERE` clause to ensure no NULL names and filter by certain movie kinds.

6. **Ordering**: The final result set is ordered by `actor_rank` and `production_year` descending for better readability.

This query incorporates several complex SQL concepts suitable for performance benchmarking in a database environment.
