This SQL query incorporates various advanced SQL features including CTEs (Common Table Expressions), outer joins, correlated subqueries, window functions, string concatenation, and NULL handling â€” all while targeting interesting data from the provided schema. It aims to rank movies, filter based on roles, count distinct casts, and also includes additional complexities through a UNION ALL.
