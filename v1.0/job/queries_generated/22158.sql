### Query Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `movie_details` aggregates movie data, counting distinct actors, keywords, and companies associated with each movie. 
2. **Joins**: 
   - A mix of left joins is used to gather data from multiple related tables.
3. **Filtering**: 
   - Only movies produced after the year 2000 and of a specific kind are included.
4. **Window Function**: 
   - The `RANK()` function orders movies based on keyword count and the number of companies involved, providing a rank for each movie.
5. **Subquery**:
   - The `CASE` statement uses a correlated subquery to check for the availability of box office info.
6. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Two cases differentiate between top movies and those without box office info status.
7. **Final Selection**:
   - The main query selects from the ranked movie CTE, applying additional filters based on completion status in the `complete_cast` table.

This query could be used to benchmark performance under complex conditions, such as filters, grouping, and ranking, thereby testing the efficiency of SQL execution paths and optimizations in the database system.
