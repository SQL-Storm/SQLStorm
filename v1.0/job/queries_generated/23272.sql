This SQL query encompasses a plethora of complex SQL constructs including:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for structuring the query into manageable pieces.
2. **Recursive CTEs** (not used practically in this example, but included for demonstration) for capturing intricate role relationships.
3. **Outer Joins** to ensure we don't lose information from primary tables.
4. **Correlated Subqueries** for fetching the first actor associated with each movie.
5. **Window Functions** to rank movies regarding recency while avoiding duplicates.
6. **Complicated predicates** for categorizing movie ages.
7. **String expressions and conditions** for the keyword handling.
8. **NULL logic** through `COALESCE` for handling potential NULL values in joins.
9. **Set operators** through aggregation of keywords.

The query retrieves detailed information about movies and their associated actors and keywords while categorizing the movies based on their production age. The usage of filters, ordering, and nuanced handling of NULL vs non-NULL cases presents an intricate example of SQL capabilities.
