### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):**
   - `RankedMovies`: This CTE ranks movies based on the number of distinct actors they feature, partitioned by the production year.
   - `ActorInfo`: This CTE gathers actor names and counts their appearances in movies.

2. **Left Joins and Aggregation:**
   - We join the `RankedMovies` CTE with `ActorInfo` to retrieve actor-related data while allowing for NULL values if no matches are found.

3. **Subqueries:**
   - A subquery counts unique company types associated with each movie.

4. **Case Expressions:**
   - A case expression categorizes the films based on the total number of actors.

5. **Complex Conditions:**
   - The WHERE clause filters to include only the top-ranked movies based on their actor counts.

6. **Ordering:**
   - The final output is ordered by production year and movie title for clearer results.

### Note:
This query is designed for performance benchmarking by utilizing multiple SQL constructs and ensuring the query leverages the complexities available within the schema.
