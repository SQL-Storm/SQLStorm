This query achieves several features for performance benchmarking:
1. Uses a recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`) to fetch titles and their depths based on movie links.
2. Joins multiple tables, including `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `aka_title`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword`.
3. Incorporates string aggregation for keywords associated with movies using `STRING_AGG`.
4. Implements conditional logic to handle potential `NULL` values in the `production_year`.
5. Uses window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`) to rank actors based on the latest production year.
6. Includes `HAVING` to filter results based on criteria of interest (e.g., more than two cast credits).
7. Applies robust ordering to the final results.
