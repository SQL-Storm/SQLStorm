This elaborate SQL query retrieves a performance benchmark based on the relationships and attributes defined in the provided schema. It utilizes multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs), including a recursive one for movie filtering, and applies various SQL features, such as window functions, aggregate functions, and string aggregation to compile a comprehensive dataset focused on movie titles, their eras, associated keywords, and unique casting information. The query is designed to consider NULL logic, filtering out pertinent information where necessary to produce meaningful results.
