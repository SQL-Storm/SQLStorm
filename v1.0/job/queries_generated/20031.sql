### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies` calculates the ranking of movies based on the number of distinct cast members, partitioned by production year.
   - `TopMovies` filters this ranking to include only the top 5 movies for each year.
   - `MovieDetails` aggregates related information about these top movies, including company names and keywords, utilizing `COALESCE` for NULL handling.
   - `DetailedReport` includes additional computed columns like `cast_rank` and an aggregate of total cast members.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking cast members and aggregating them.
   - `SUM() OVER ()` to calculate the total number of cast members across all top movies.

3. **Outer Joins**:
   - Used throughout to retain movies even if some related information (like company names or keywords) is absent.

4. **NULL Logic**:
   - Usage of `COALESCE` to handle NULL values gracefully, ensuring the output remains informative even if data is missing.

5. **Complex Predicates**:
   - Conditions in the final `SELECT` statement ensure that only relevant movies with cast information are included, showcasing unusual SQL conditions that mix NULL logic and counts.

6. **Ordered Output**:
   - Final results sorted by production year and the total cast in descending order, exhibiting the query's comprehensive analytical structure. 

This query creates an elaborate structure designed for performance benchmarking while effectively utilizing the rich schema provided.
