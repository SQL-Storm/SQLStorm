This SQL query utilizes various complex constructs suitable for performance benchmarking:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` captures a hierarchy of movies linked together.
2. **Window Functions**: `FIRST_VALUE` computes the year of the first movie for each actor while partitioning by actor's ID.
3. **Subquery**: Calculates movie age by extracting the production year from the current date.
4. **Aggregations**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG` summarize data about actors and their movies.
5. **CASE Statements**: Classifies actors as either "Veteran Actor" or "Newcomer Actor" based on the count of films they have worked on.
6. **LEFT JOIN**: Used to include all actors regardless of whether they have linked movies.
7. **NULL Logic**: Filters out actors with non-null names and those without notes in the cast info table.
8. **HAVING clause**: Ensures only actors with more than 3 films are included in the results. 

This elaborate query aims to provide insights into actor performances while testing database efficiency under complex conditions.
