This SQL query constructs a recursive common table expression (CTE) to generate a hierarchy of movies based on their links. It examines movies produced between 2000 and 2020, aggregating various data points such as actor names, production years, the number of companies involved, keywords associated with the movies, and average lengths of additional movie info. It also implements various join operations, including LEFT JOINs, and uses window functions to rank movie entries. The use of string aggregation and conditions based on NULL values showcases complex logic and structures that can benefit benchmarking.
