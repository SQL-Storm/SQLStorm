This SQL query accomplishes several tasks:

1. It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) `MovieHierarchy` to build a hierarchy of movies linked together by their IDs, starting from movies produced after the year 2000.

2. It creates another CTE `ActorRoles` to list actors and their roles in movies, applying a window function (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to rank the roles based on the production year.

3. It defines a third CTE `PopularMovies` which filters for movies that have more than 3 actors in the cast.

4. Finally, it selects from the `PopularMovies` and joins the results with `ActorRoles`, ordering them by release year, title, and rank of the role. 

The query includes concepts such as CTEs, joins, window functions, conditional filters, and aggregates, making it comprehensive for performance benchmarking scenarios.
