This SQL query includes:
1. **CTEs**: Used for recursive movie casting and filtering by movie keywords.
2. **JOINs**: Utilizes inner joins and left joins to gather data across multiple tables.
3. **Correlated subqueries**: Utilizes subquery logic within common table expressions.
4. **Window Functions**: Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to order actors within each movie.
5. **Complicated predicates**: Applies a range of predicates to filter results based on conditions related to the number of actors.
6. **String Expressions**: Aggregates keywords into a single string.
7. **NULL Logic**: Handles potential NULL values in various parts of the query. 

This structure showcases advanced SQL features and handles complex logic while performing necessary aggregations and filters.
