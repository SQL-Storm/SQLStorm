### Explanation of Constructs Used:

1. **CTEs**: 
   - `ActorHierarchy` recursively builds a hierarchy of actors based on their movie appearances.
   - `MovieYears` selects and filters for relevant movies based on production year.
   - `FilteredMovies` aggregates actor counts and identifies the latest production year for each movie.
   - `TopMovies` ranks the movies based on the number of actors and filters to the top ten.

2. **Joins**: 
   - The final selection uses multiple joins to combine movie titles with actor names and their corresponding roles.

3. **Window Function**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is employed in `TopMovies` to rank the movies based on the criteria specified.

4. **Outer Join**: 
   - A left join is performed in `FilteredMovies` to ensure movies without actors are included and counted appropriately.

5. **Null Logic**: 
   - The use of `COALESCE` ensures that if no role note exists, a default string is presented.

6. **Complicated predicates/expressions/calculations**: 
   - The filtering logic utilizes several conditions to refine results (i.e., only include movies post-2000).

7. **Ordering**: 
   - Results are ordered by the count of actors and then by movie title for clarity.

This query would provide insight into highly casted movies from the 2000s, alongside their leading actors, allowing for performance benchmarking of joins and aggregations.
