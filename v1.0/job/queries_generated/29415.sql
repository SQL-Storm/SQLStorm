This SQL query performs a complex string processing benchmark on the `aka_title`, `cast_info`, `keyword`, and `movie_info` tables, selecting the top 10 movies from the 2000 onwards based on their production year and title. It joins these tables to provide detailed movie information, including the total number of cast members and associated keywords while formatting the output with a concatenated movie title and production year.
