### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE:** The `MovieHierarchy` CTE recursively gathers movies linked to the originating movie, capturing potential franchises or sequels.
2. **Calculations and Aggregations**:
   - `total_cast`: Counts distinct roles played in each movie.
   - `cast_names`: Aggregates unique actor names into a single string.
   - `release_date`: Retrieves the release date information if available.
   - `award_count`: Counts any awards won by the movies based on given award type IDs.
   - `keyword_count`: Counts distinct keywords associated with each movie.
3. **Joins**: Outer joins are used for `complete_cast`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`, `movie_info`, and `movie_keyword` to ensure all movies are included, even if some data is missing (NULLs).
4. **GROUP BY**: Groups the results by movie, allowing aggregation.
5. **LIMIT**: Restricts the output to the top 10 movies based on the total cast and keyword count, useful for benchmarking performance with different datasets.
