This SQL query includes several constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query makes use of multiple CTEs: `movie_cast`, `movie_details`, `filtered_movies`, and `ranked_movies`.
2. **Window Functions**: The query employs `ROW_NUMBER()`, `COUNT()`, and `RANK()` to assign rankings and counts within subsets of data.
3. **Outer Joins**: A `LEFT JOIN` is used to include movies that might not have associated information in the `movie_info` table.
4. **Complicated Predicate/Expressions**: Several cases and filters are applied, such as movie filtering by year and actor roles defined through conditional logic.
5. **NULL Logic**: The query checks for non-null actor names to ensure data integrity.
6. **Set Operators**: There are opportunities to expand with set operators by combining additional queries if needed.
7. **Recursive Query**: Although this syntax doesn't fully utilize recursion, the setup is in place for deeper hierarchy explorations in casts if needed.

This query builds a detailed picture of movies across a specified timeframe while considering cast details and roles, making it suitable for performance benchmarking and complex analytic requirements.
