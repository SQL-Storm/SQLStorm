This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. It uses a recursive CTE to build a hierarchy of movies, allowing for exploration of linked movies.
2. It joins this hierarchy with actor names and movie titles, capturing additional details like production year.
3. It aggregates keyword counts and calculates average durations using conditional aggregation with a correlated subquery for more specific information types.
4. It utilizes `ROW_NUMBER()` as a window function to rank the movies based on the production year.
5. It filters on specific criteria in the `HAVING` clause and orders the final results accordingly, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the data.
