This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. **Recursive CTE** called `MovieHierarchy`: This CTE builds a hierarchy of movies produced since the year 2000, linking them through a junction table that connects movies and companies. The recursion identifies linked movies, allowing for dependencies to be captured.

2. **RankedMovies CTE**: This layer ranks the movies by depth to organize them better within their respective production years.

3. **FilteredMovies CTE**: This filters the ranked movies to only include the top 5 movies by depth for each production year.

4. **Final SELECT**: The query then selects the titles of the movies along with a list of distinct companies and actor names, grouping the results by movie title and ordering them by the number of distinct actors associated with each title. Results are limited to the top 10 movies with the most actors.

The usage of outer joins, `ARRAY_AGG`, `STRING_AGG`, window functions like `ROW_NUMBER`, along with the recursive CTE structure provides an elaborate performance benchmark scenario while fulfilling the requirement for complexity and depth in the SQL query.
