This SQL query performs a performance benchmarking exercise by utilizing a recursive common table expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of actors based on their relationships in films. It counts co-actor appearances and aggregates keywords associated with movies while applying multiple join conditions and filtering criteria. It also incorporates window functions to rank movies based on the number of co-actors and ensures relevant datasets are included by using LEFT JOINs and GROUP BY clauses. The final results are filtered to only show actors who have appeared with more than five co-actors in movies produced after the year 2000.
