This SQL query is designed to benchmark performance while utilizing various advanced SQL constructs in a complex input schema. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies that are linked together, starting with movies from 2000 onward.

2. **LEFT and RIGHT Joins**: Various tables are joined to gather complete information about titles, cast, and associated keywords.

3. **Aggregation**: The query includes grouping with `GROUP_CONCAT` and `SUM`, while using `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values.

4. **Window Functions**: A rank is assigned to each cast member based on the count of movies they have participated in.

5. **Set Operators**: A subquery is utilized to filter the `kind_id`s based on specified criteria.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause checks for multiple conditions, including NULL logic and pattern matching.

7. **Output**: The final select projects the relevant fields, orders the output by the total cast order and production year, providing insights useful for benchmarking query performance.
