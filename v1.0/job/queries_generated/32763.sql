This SQL query explores a movie database by retrieving information about actors, their movies, production companies, and associated keywords. It includes a recursive CTE to handle movie relationships, aggregates data for actor counts and keywords, and evaluates the average length of information related to moviesâ€”all while applying NULL logic and string expressions. Ordering and filtering conditions make it useful for performance benchmarking in a diverse context.
