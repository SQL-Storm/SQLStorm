This SQL query performs a performance benchmark by analyzing details about movies and their corresponding actors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `actor_hierarchy`: This recursive CTE captures actors and their roles in movies, tracking the depth of their participation.
   - `movie_details`: This aggregates titles, their production years, counts of unique actors, and calculates the average depth of the cast from `actor_hierarchy`.
   - `movie_keywords`: This collects keywords associated with each movie.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - It selects movie titles and production years from `movie_details`, adds keyword information using a left join on `movie_keywords`, and classifies the era based on the year the movie was produced.
   - The results are filtered to include only movies with more than 5 actors.

3. **String Aggregation**: It uses `STRING_AGG` to create a comma-separated list of keywords for each movie.

4. **Complex Case Statement**: A `CASE` expression categorizes movies into 'Classic', 'Modern', or 'Recent' based on their production year.

5. **NULL Handling**: `COALESCE` is used to handle cases where a movie may not have associated keywords.

This query demonstrates various advanced SQL techniques and constructs while addressing performance benchmarking concerns by aggregating data efficiently.
