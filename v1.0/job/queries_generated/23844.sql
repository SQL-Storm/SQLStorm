This SQL query makes use of several advanced constructs including:

1. A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to create a hierarchy of movies linked to each other through the `movie_link` table.
2. Aggregate functions such as `STRING_AGG` and `AVG` with DISTINCT to handle duplicates cleanly.
3. A combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `JOIN` to manage associations across several related tables, including aliases for clarity.
4. STRING manipulation with `CONCAT_WS` for more readable concatenated outputs in the aggregation.
5. Conditional logic in the `HAVING` clause to filter on aggregate calculations.
6. A complex `WHERE` clause that incorporates multiple checks and NULL logic to ensure robust filtering.
7. The use of ordering and limits to control output for performance benchmarking scenarios. 

This combination of techniques demonstrates complex querying capabilities to derive meaningful data insights from the database schema provided.
