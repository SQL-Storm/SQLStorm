-- Order of execution brings up interesting edge cases:
-- 1. Use of window functions to rank within years and average info type counts.
-- 2. Complex CASE statements categorize based on keyword counts.
-- 3. Perhaps bizarre association with NULL logic to ensure movies not present in a main title dataset.
