Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the query:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Ranks movies within their kind by production year.
   - `TopRatedMovies`: Calculates the average rating for each movie.
   - `NullSafeMovieReviews`: Combines average ratings and categorizes the ratings safely handling NULLs.
   - `PersonMovieRoles`: Retrieves actors and their roles for all movies in the result sets.

2. **Outer Join**: Utilized in `NullSafeMovieReviews` to ensure that all movies are preserved regardless of whether they have ratings.

3. **Window Functions**: Employed to rank movies and to order roles for actors with `ROW_NUMBER()`.

4. **COALESCE & CASE Statements**: Used for NULL handling and creating custom rating categories from movie ratings.

5. **Subquery for IN Clause**: Filters companies based on a specific country code.

6. **ORDER BY and LIMIT**: Orders the final results by average ratings and role order, limiting the output to 100 records.

This query captures a significant part of the schema while also demonstrating advanced SQL techniques, making it suitable for performance benchmarking.
