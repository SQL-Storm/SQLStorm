### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: The query begins with three CTEs.
    - `ranked_movies`: This selects the top-ranked movies grouped by production year, assigning a rank to each based on the movie ID (descending).
    - `actor_appearance`: This calculates actor counts and creates a concatenated string of actor names for each movie.
    - `title_with_actor_info`: This joins the previous two CTEs, calculating fields to determine if a movie has actors and filling counts with COALESCE.

2. **Final Selection**: The main SELECT statement retrieves relevant information but also includes a correlated subquery to count the number of earlier movies produced.

3. **Complicated Predicates and Expressions**: 
    - Use of `COALESCE` to handle NULL values for the actor counts.
    - Use of a case statement to classify movies based on actor presence.
    
4. **NULL Logic**: Utilizes `LEFT JOIN` to access potentially NULL counts of actors and controls flow with `CASE` statements.

5. **Sorting and Limiting Results**: The results are ordered by production year and actor count, limiting the output for performance benchmarking purposes.

This query showcases a mix of SQL features with a focus on complexity and performance metrics.
