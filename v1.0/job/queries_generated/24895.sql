This SQL query employs various constructs, including:
1. **CTEs**: A recursive CTE to manage movie hierarchies.
2. **Outer Joins**: LEFT JOIN used to include keywords and person_info that might not exist for all movies.
3. **GROUP BY and Aggregations**: Aggregating data to count distinct keywords and total roles, compute averages, and limit results based on certain criteria.
4. **HAVING**: To filter groups based on returned aggregated values.
5. **Complex Conditions**: Includes NULL checks and subqueries for specific conditions, adding to the performance complexity of the query, while using string expressions and calculations.
6. **FILTER**: A window function style approach in an aggregate context to gain additional insights.
7. **Subqueries**: Within the CASE statements to define specific criteria. 

This approach gives a comprehensive look at the interplay of individuals in the movie schema, their roles, and ratings, while filtering and sorting based on intricate criteria.
