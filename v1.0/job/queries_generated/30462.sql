### Explanation of query components:
1. **Recursive CTE (ActorHierarchy)**: This part builds a hierarchical structure of actors and their roles up to any level, showcasing how they relate within the movies.
2. **Outer Joins**: The use of `LEFT JOIN` allows for comprehensive aggregation of actor roles while preserving all records from the hierarchy.
3. **Aggregations**: The query counts movies and computes the average role order using window functions, while also aggregating keywords associated with each movie.
4. **Set Operators**: The combination of distinct keywords is performed using `STRING_AGG` to present a comprehensive view.
5. **Complicated Conditions**: The filtering conditions include year checks and restrictions based on movie count, ensuring a focus on prolific actors.
6. **String Expressions**: The `CONCAT` function constructs clear hierarchical representations of actor roles.
7. **NULL Handling**: Logic is included to avoid NULL values for average calculations.

This query should serve well for performance benchmarking by testing various SQL constructs and efficient data processing within the provided schema.
