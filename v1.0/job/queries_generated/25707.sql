### Explanation:
- **Selected Columns**: The query retrieves the actor's name, movie title, year of production, associated keywords, actor's role, and the name of the production company.
- **Joins**:
  - `aka_name` is joined with `cast_info` to connect actors to their roles.
  - `cast_info` is joined with `title` to get the movie details.
  - `movie_keyword` and `keyword` are joined to aggregate movie keywords.
  - `movie_companies` and `company_name` are left joined to obtain the company name associated with the movie, if any.
  - `role_type` is left joined to include the role of the actor.
- **Filters**: It includes only movies released between 2000 and 2023 and ensures that the actorâ€™s name is present.
- **Grouping**: The query groups results by actor and movie to allow the aggregation of keywords.
- **Ordering**: Results are ordered by production year in descending order and then by actor's name.
