This SQL query performs the following elaborate steps:

1. **Recursive CTE (MovieHierarchy)**: This builds a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, starting from movies produced in the year 2000 and later.

2. **ActorMovies CTE**: This collects all the movies for each actor who acted in films made after 2000, ranking their movies based on the production year.

3. **TopActors CTE**: From the `ActorMovies` CTE, this subset filters the actors who have been in at least 5 movies, selecting only their top 3 most recent movies for aggregation.

4. Finally, the main SELECT statement combines data from the `MovieHierarchy`, `ActorMovies`, and `TopActors` to display each movieâ€™s title, production year, actor's name, and the number of movies the actor has been in, ordered by production year and movie count. 

This query features a variety of SQL constructs, including CTEs, window functions, joins, and filtering through HAVING clauses for performance benchmarking.
