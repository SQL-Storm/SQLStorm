This SQL query accomplishes the following:

1. Creates a recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`) to traverse a movie link hierarchy for movies produced after 2000, limiting the depth of recursion to avoid overly deep paths.
2. Joins the actor names, cast information, and movie hierarchy information while allowing for left joins to capture additional data such as production companies and movie info that could contain nulls.
3. Filters results for non-null names and specifies criteria on the production year.
4. Groups results by actor name, movie title, and production year to facilitate aggregated calculations.
5. Uses the `HAVING` clause to include only those movies that have more than 2 distinct production companies.
6. Orders the final result by average info length in descending order and by production year.

The overall complexity of the query showcases various SQL constructs beneficial for performance benchmarking, including window functions, outer joins, recursive queries, and intricate predicates.
