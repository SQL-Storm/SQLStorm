This SQL query serves as a performance benchmark by querying various aspects of the `Join Order Benchmark` schema:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses multiple CTEs to segment the processing into logical parts:
   - `MovieDetails` gathers movie information and associated keywords.
   - `ActorNames` retrieves actor names and calculates the number of spaces in their names to introduce some arbitrary complexity.
   - `BestPerformingMovies` identifies movies with more than 3 actors, making a correlation with performance.
   - `FinalResults` compiles the final data set, grouping by movie with actor-related calculations.

2. **String Expressions**: The `STRING_AGG` function concatenates actor names into a comma-separated list.

3. **Window Functions**: The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` provides an ordered list of names and titles.

4. **NULL Logic**: The clause `HAVING COUNT(*) > 3` ensures we only consider movies with a significant cast size, and `ALLOWING NULLS` in `WHERE unique_actors >= 2` illustrates handling of potential NULL values.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The query conditions incorporate counting, ordering, and aggregating across various dimensions, and sorting brings in various NULL-handling semantics.

6. **Bizarre Semantic Corner Cases**: The combination of filters and aggregations introduces elements that may not be common, such as calculating spaces in names.

This query comprehensively demonstrates the potential complexity and reward of SQL constructs within the provided schema.
