This query includes:
- A recursive common table expression (CTE) to establish a movie hierarchy based on links between movies.
- Aggregate functions to count and summarize movie data.
- Complex predicates filtering by year and categorizing results.
- Using `string_agg` to create a hierarchical path of movie titles linked through movie links.
- Several joins, including an outer join to capture potential NULLs from the movie hierarchy.
- Grouping and ordering to provide a performance benchmark report from diverse data sources while demonstrating complex SQL constructs.
