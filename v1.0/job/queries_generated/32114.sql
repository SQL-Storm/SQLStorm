This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. It defines a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) `movie_hierarchy` to explore movie relationships within the production years starting from 2000.
2. It selects actor names from `aka_name`, along with associated movie titles and production years, counting unique roles and aggregating the keywords associated with the movies.
3. It employs a `LEFT JOIN` to include company information, with a COALESCE function to handle potential NULL values seamlessly.
4. The query uses `RANK()` window function to rank movies per production year based on the number of roles.
5. Thereâ€™s filtering to include only those roles with a specific order (`c.nr_order = 1`) and includes conditions to ensure either keyword or production year is not NULL.
6. The final output is grouped by actor name, movie title, and production year, with a condition to ensure there are significant roles (`HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.person_role_id) > 1`).

This query efficiently combines several SQL constructs for complex data analysis.
