This SQL query incorporates various constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), outer joins, `STRING_AGG`, window functions, and case statements. It also utilizes a recursive CTE to explore hierarchical data in the titles, aggregates names associated with each person, counts companies tied to titles, and categorizes titles based on their production years into distinct eras. The query uses both standard SQL logic and some unconventional checks to illustrate corner cases, ensuring comprehensive performance benchmarking insights.
