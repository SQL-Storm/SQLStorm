This query constructs several common table expressions (CTEs) to break down the task into manageable parts. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each CTE:

1. **RankedMovies**: This CTE generates a ranked list of movies by production year, counting distinct cast members and assigning a rank based on keyword relevance.
  
2. **FilteredMovies**: It filters the ranked movies to include only those with more than 5 cast members and the highest keyword rank per production year.
  
3. **MovieDetails**: This CTE fetches additional information such as movie info, and a concatenated list of actors, handling cases where movie info might be absent.
  
4. **FinalResults**: Lastly, it ranks these movies by production year and categorizes them as 'Recent Release' or 'Older Release'.

The final SELECT statement pulls everything together, ensuring to handle potential NULL values, sorting by production date, and including categorized release info.
