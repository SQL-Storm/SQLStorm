This SQL query performs complex operations by utilizing recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, window functions for ranking, and grouped results. It retrieves titles from the `aka_title` table produced after the year 2000, counts cast members, filters keywords based on a certain criteria, and handles outer joins and conditional logic to create a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The final output is limited to the top 50 records based on the specified ranking and ordering conditions.
