This SQL query generates a ranked list of the top 10 movies produced after the year 2000 that have the highest number of associated keywords, along with their titles, production years, and the names of the actors. The movies are filtered to include only those produced by companies based in the USA or the UK. The use of `STRING_AGG` ensures that all actors are grouped into a single string, while window functions like `RANK()` allow for effective ranking of the results.
