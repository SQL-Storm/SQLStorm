### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Ranks movies based on the number of casts for each production year.
   - `PopularActors`: Filters actors who have appeared in more than five movies.
   - `MovieGenres`: Extracts genres associated with each movie.

2. **Joins**:
   - Uses **LEFT JOIN** to include movies without casts and **JOIN** to filter based on the cast counts and genres.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - The `DENSE_RANK()` function is used to assign ranks within the `RankedMovies` CTE.

4. **Aggregation**:
   - **ARRAY_AGG** is used to collect distinct genres associated with a movie in an array.

5. **Bizarre Logic**:
   - A filter that selects only movies after 2023 (a future expectation) if their cast count is fewer than five, introducing a nonsensical element.

6. **HAVING Clause**:
   - Ensuring the results meet conditions involving cast counts and presence of genres.

This query showcases the use of various SQL constructs and explores some obscure logic pathways that add an unusual twist to the expected output while keeping it engaging.
