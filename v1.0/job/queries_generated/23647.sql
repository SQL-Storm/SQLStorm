This SQL query generates a performance benchmarking case which makes use of recursive common table expressions (CTEs), aggregations, outer joins, window functions, null logic, complex predicates, and even handles the corner case of fetching titles with zero actors. The goal is to analyze titles after the year 2000 and aggregate relevant actor information while dealing with various conditions and filters.
