-- This SQL query benchmarks string processing by joining multiple tables to extract relevant information about movies along with their cast and keywords.

SELECT 
    t.title AS movie_title,
    t.production_year,
    t.kind_id,
    a.name AS actor_name,
    c.kind AS cast_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT mk.keyword) AS total_keywords,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT mk.keyword, ', ') AS keywords_list
FROM 
    title t
JOIN 
    movie_keyword mk ON t.id = mk.movie_id
JOIN

JOIN 
    cast_info ci ON t.id = ci.movie_id
JOIN 
    aka_name a ON ci.person_id = a.person_id
JOIN 
    comp_cast_type c ON ci.person_role_id = c.id
WHERE 
    t.production_year >= 2000
    AND LENGTH(a.name) > 5  -- Filtering for actor names longer than 5 characters
GROUP BY 
    t.id, a.name, t.production_year, t.kind_id, c.kind
ORDER BY 
    t.production_year DESC, total_keywords DESC

### Explanation:
- This SQL query retrieves information about movies, their cast, and associated keywords.
- It utilizes multiple table joins to fetch data from `title`, `movie_keyword`, `movie_companies`, `company_name`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`, and `comp_cast_type`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to only include movies produced in or after 2000 and restricts the actor names to those longer than five characters, which enhances string processing.
- The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate results by movie and actor.
- The `STRING_AGG` function collects all distinct keywords for each movie into a single, comma-separated string.
- Finally, the results are ordered by the production year (most recent first) and the total number of keywords associated with each movie, with a limit of 10 results to focus the benchmark.
