This query performs multiple subqueries and aggregations to benchmark string processing within the context of a movie database. It captures movies produced between 2000 and 2020, associates each with the actors starred in them along with their respective keywords, sums up relevant information including the number of actors and assorted keywords, and filters for movies with more than 5 actors, finally sorting the results.
