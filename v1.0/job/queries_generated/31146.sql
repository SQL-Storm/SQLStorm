### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The recursive CTE `movie_hierarchy` is utilized to create a hierarchy of movies, taking into account linked movies. It starts with original titles and joins on the movies that are linked to get a recursive relationship.

2. **Joins**: The final SELECT statement joins multiple tables to gather detailed information about the movies, their casts, and related information.

3. **Aggregations and Window Functions**:
   - `COUNT(c.id) AS cast_count`: Counts the number of cast members for each movie.
   - `STRING_AGG(DISTINCT a.name, ', ') AS actors`: Concatenates unique actor names per movie into a single string.
   - `AVG(CAST(mi.info AS FLOAT)) FILTER (WHERE mi.info_type_id = 1) AS average_rating`: Calculates the average rating from the `movie_info` table based on a specific info type.
   - `MAX(mi.info) FILTER (WHERE mi.info_type_id = 2) AS max_budget`: Retrieves the maximum budget if it exists in another info type.

4. **Filtering and Grouping**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the movies produced between 2000 and 2020.
   - The `HAVING` clause ensures only movies with more than 5 cast members are included.
   - Results are grouped by movie title and production year.

5. **Ordering and Limiting**: The final output is sorted by `production_year` and `cast_count`, and only the top 10 results are returned. 

This query is comprehensive and utilizes various SQL constructs to deliver valuable insights on movie performance and cast information, making it suitable for performance benchmarking.
