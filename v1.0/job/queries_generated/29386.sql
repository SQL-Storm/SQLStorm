This SQL query provides a comprehensive overview of movies, including their titles, production years, genre types, the number of production companies involved, and the names of notable actors (those who have appeared in multiple films). The use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) allows for organized subqueries to simplify complex data extraction. This query can serve as a benchmark for string processing with aggregation and filtering functionalities.
