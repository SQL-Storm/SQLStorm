This SQL query uses various advanced constructs such as:

1. A recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) to analyze movie connections.
2. Joining multiple tables through several types of joins, including left joins for information that may not exist (NULL logic).
3. Using the `STRING_AGG` function to combine keywords for each movie.
4. Employing window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`) to rank actors based on their average ratings.
5. Filtering and grouping data accordingly, showcasing complex predicates within the `WHERE` clause. 

The query is structured to not only retrieve useful data but also perform benchmarks through performance-heavy operations such as aggregating large datasets and managing recursive relationships between movies.
