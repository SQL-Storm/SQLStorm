This SQL query involves several advanced constructs:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to break the query into manageable parts.
- **Recursive CTE** to compute actor counts and summarize roles for films released after the year 2000.
- **Window Functions** such as `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank movies by the length of notes and actor count.
- **COALESCE** function to handle NULL values gracefully.
- **OUTER JOIN** to allow for missing data without eliminating rows from the result.
- **Filtering criteria** to include movies with certain actor counts and note lengths.
- **String manipulation** to check for substrings in names and notes, creating complex filtering logic.
- **Handling of NULL logic** to ensure entries with NULL notes are captured with default values.
- **ORDER BY** clause is used to prioritize results based on year, actor count, and title. 

The query essentially retrieves detailed information about movies from the Join Order Benchmark schema, focusing on entries from a specified time range.
