### Explanation of SQL Query Constructs:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: The query uses several CTEs (`RankedTitles`, `AggregateMovies`, `CastInfoRanked`, `FilteredMovies`) to modularize the logic and prepare intermediate results.

2. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` are used within CTEs to rank titles and roles, respectively, to investigate how these relate to the data.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: Use of `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` and `AVG(...)` in the `AggregateMovies` CTE to gather statistics about movies by company type.

4. **Null Logic**: We handle NULL values with `COALESCE` to ensure that if no matches are found, we still return zero for `total_cast`.

5. **Complicated Predicates/Expressions**: The `HAVING` clause in `FilteredMovies` imposes a condition that requires more than five distinct cast members post-2000 to keep a movie.

6. **Outer Joins**: `LEFT JOIN` operations are used to include all records from the first table while matching records from the second, handling cases where there might not be matches.

7. **Set Membership with Subqueries**: The main query references a subquery in a WHERE clause, allowing filtering based on computations performed in the CTEs.

8. **Order By Clause**: The results are sorted by `production_year` and `title`, showcasing complex criteria for ordered output.

This query can be particularly useful for performance benchmarking by interacting with multiple database features and functionalities, allowing for complex evaluation scenarios.
