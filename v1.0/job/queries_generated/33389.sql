This SQL query demonstrates an elaborate use of several SQL constructs. 

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE recursively constructs a hierarchy of movies linked by their relationships.
2. **Aggregate Functions**: The `AggregatedMovies` CTE aggregates movies, counting unique cast members (`cast_count`) and concatenating their names (`actor_names`) using `STRING_AGG()`.
3. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` function in the `PopularMovies` CTE ranks movies based on the number of cast members for each production year.
4. **Outer Joins**: LEFT JOINS are used to include all movies even if they donâ€™t have associated cast entries.
5. **Final Selection**: The final selection retrieves the top 5 movies each year based on cast size, ordered by year and then by cast count. 

This approach allows for comprehensive insights into the movie database.
