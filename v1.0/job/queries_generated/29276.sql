This elaborate SQL query creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `movie_details` that aggregates various details about movies, including their alternate names (via the `aka_name`), keywords (via `movie_keyword` and `keyword`), companies associated with the movies (via `movie_companies` and `company_name`), and the cast and their roles (via `cast_info` and `role_type`). 

The second CTE, `ranked_movies`, ranks these movies based on the total number of cast members involved. Finally, the query retrieves the top 10 ranked movies produced after the year 2000, displaying concatenated strings for alternate names, keywords, companies, and roles.
