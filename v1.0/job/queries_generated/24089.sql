### Explanation of Complex Constructs:
1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This constructs a hierarchical view of movies and their linked relationships, allowing us to explore connections between movies up to two levels deep.
  
2. **Aggregates and Subqueries**: Uses subqueries within the main query to calculate counts and other aggregates like `COUNT(DISTINCT mh.movie_id)` within the CTE, and to filter on `info_type`.

3. **Outer Joins**: Includes `LEFT JOIN`s to ensure that even if related keywords or movie information are not available, the query still returns data about actors.

4. **Correlated Subquery**: Inside the SELECT list, for counting the total movies in the hierarchy for additional context on production links.

5. **Use of `COALESCE` and Conditional Aggregation**: Handle potential `NULL` values for the production year and roles, enriching data presentation.

6. **HAVING Clause**: Filtering actors based on their roles gives an additional aspect to the performance benchmarking.

7. **String Expressions**: Utilizes `GROUP_CONCAT` to concatenate keywords associated with movies featuring the cast, requiring them to be aggregated properly.

8. **Bizarre Edge Cases**: The presence of handling `IS NULL` case and ensuring role counts have context adds an unusual angle to the performance metrics.

9. **Sorting and Limiting the Results**: Orders results by role count and actor name, whilst limiting the output to only the top 10 entries for brevity in performance benchmarking results.

This elaborate SQL showcases advanced SQL features suitable for performance benchmarking in a movie database context.
