This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE named `MovieHierarchy` constructs a hierarchy of movies linked together, filtering only those produced between 2000 and 2020.

2. **Joins**:
   - Joins on `complete_cast`, `aka_name`, `aka_title`, `movie_keyword`, `movie_companies`, and `char_name` to fetch information related to characters, actors, movies, keywords, and companies involved in creating the movies.

3. **Aggregations**:
   - It groups results by actor names and titles while counting distinct keywords associated with the movies.
   - It sums up the counts for independent companies based on their `company_type_id`.

4. **Window Function**: Utilizes the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank roles of actors based on the production year of the movies.

5. **String Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to create a comma-separated list of keywords associated with each movie.

6. **Complicated Predicate**: The `HAVING` clause ensures only actors who participated in movies with more than 5 distinct keywords are considered.

7. **NULL Logic**: Handles potential `NULL` values in the `company_type_id` using a `CASE` statement.

8. **Ordering**: Results are ordered by the `production_year` of the movies in descending order, followed by actor names. 

This query is structured to benchmark query performance across several complex constructs while maintaining clarity in its purpose and results.
