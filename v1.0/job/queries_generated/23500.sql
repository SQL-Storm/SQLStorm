This SQL query uses multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to rank, filter, and aggregate movie data from the provided schema, incorporating various SQL constructs such as window functions, outer joins, and string aggregation. It assesses movie companies related to its cast and analyzes the resultant film dataset based on a set of defined criteria. The query even evaluates company involvement and dynamically categorizes it based on performance measures, adding a layer of complexity with use of NULL handling, conditions, and groupings.
