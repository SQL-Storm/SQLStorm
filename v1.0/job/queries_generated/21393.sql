### Query Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (movie_hierarchy)**: This builds a hierarchy of movies based on linked relationships, allowing for recursion to find movies linked to others and track the depth of those links.
2. **Actor Information CTE (actor_info)**: This collects actors with more than 5 roles and counts their total roles, ensuring we only include those prolific in their careers.
3. **Complex Keywords CTE (complex_keywords)**: This aggregates keywords associated with movies into a single string, which can be useful for additional context.
4. **Main Query**: 
   - Joins the CTE results to select movie titles, levels in the hierarchy, actor names and their role counts, and concatenated keywords.
   - Uses a correlated subquery to filter actors that appeared in the movies captured in the hierarchy.
   - NULL logic is illustrated using COALESCE to handle cases where no keywords are associated with a movie.
   - The final output is ordered by movie level, role count, and title, demonstrating a sophisticated combination of SQL features.
