This query benchmarks the performance by integrating various SQL constructs, such as:

- A recursive CTE `MovieHierarchy` to establish a hierarchy of movies and their connections.
- Outer joins with `LEFT JOIN` to include movies with or without associated keywords.
- Complex predicates checking for NULL values and string expressions using `UPPER()` and `LIKE`.
- Window functions via aggregations and counts to analyze the frequency of roles played and associated keywords.
- Use of the `COALESCE` function to manage NULL logic within the role assignment.
- `STRING_AGG` to consolidate keywords into a single string.

This results in a comprehensive output centered around actors, their movies, roles, and associated keywords, filtered and grouped for meaningful analysis and benchmarking performance across various SQL operations.
