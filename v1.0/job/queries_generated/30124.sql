### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This part builds a hierarchy of movies linked to each other. It starts by selecting movies and recursively fetches linked movies.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Selects actor names and calculates co-actors, total movies, and average production years.
   - It uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate movie titles and categorizes the movies into "Classic" or "Modern" based on production year.

3. **JOINs**:
   - Various joins are used (inner, left) to gather all necessary data from various tables.
   - `aka_name` links actors to their names, while `complete_cast` and the recursive CTE link movies.

4. **Group By and Having**:
   - The results are grouped by actor name and filtered to include only actors who have acted in more than 5 movies.

5. **Ordering and Limiting**:
   - The results are ordered by the latest movie year and limited to the top 10 actors.

This query is complex and utilizes several advanced SQL features for performance benchmarking.
