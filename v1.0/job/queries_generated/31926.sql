This SQL query does the following:

1. **Recursive CTE**: It creates a recursive common table expression (`movie_hierarchy`) to find all movies produced from the year 2000 onward and their linked movies hierarchically.

2. **Joins and Aggregations**: It joins several tables like `movie_keyword`, `cast_info`, `name`, and `person_info` to gather more details about each movieâ€™s keywords, cast information, and actor traits (specifically gender).

3. **Conditional Logic**: Utilizes conditional aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `MAX`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG` to compute:
   - Total distinct movies per keyword.
   - The latest production year of movies for each keyword.
   - The maximum role order from `cast_info`.
   - The percentage of male actors involved in these movies.
   - A concatenated string of all actor names per keyword.

4. **Predicate Filtering**: The query ensures that only keywords that have more than one movie are included in the final results.

5. **Ordering**: Finally, the results are ordered by the total number of movies associated with each keyword in descending order.

This structure allows for a comprehensive analysis of movie keywords, reflecting on trends in the cast and related production attributes, making it suitable for performance benchmarking scenarios.
