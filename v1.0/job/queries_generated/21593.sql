This query constructs a detailed performance benchmark that integrates various SQL constructs such as:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Multiple CTEs are used, including a recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) for handling movie episodes, along with a ranking CTE (`ranked_movies`) to organize movies by release year and title.

2. **Outer Joins**: The `LEFT JOIN` is utilized to include movies without cast information. 

3. **Window Functions**: Functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()` and `COUNT()` are used to generate rankings and to count the cast members.

4. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` compiles keywords per movie.

5. **Complex Predicates**: The query's `WHERE` clause demonstrates complex conditions combining various logical operators.

6. **CASE Statements and NULL Logic**: It also includes logical cases to categorize cast sizes and handle NULL values intelligently utilizing `COALESCE()` and `NULLIF()`.

The final selection filters out additional details for movies with less than 10 cast members and ranks the top five titles per production year.
