### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (MovieHierarchy)**: The `WITH RECURSIVE` construct creates a hierarchy of movies based on linked movies. The initial query selects movies of a certain kind (e.g., 'movie'), and recursively looks for linked movies, incrementing the depth with each recursion.
  
2. **Main Query**: 
   - Joins the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and `complete_cast` tables to gather relevant data on actors, movies they acted in, and their roles.
   - Left joins the `MovieHierarchy` to gain insights into the depths of movie relationships.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters out null names and roles.
   - Aggregation functions are used:
     - `COUNT` counts distinct movies acted in.
     - `ARRAY_AGG` collects movie titles.
     - `SUM` calculations count how many of the movies are in shallow or deep hierarchy levels.
     - `STRING_AGG` compiles roles into a single text string.

3. **HAVING Clause**: Ensures that only actors who appeared in more than five movies are returned.

4. **Order and Limit**: Results are ordered by the number of movies and limited to the top 10 actors. 

This query encapsulates complex constructs including outer joins, correlated subqueries, window functions, and various aggregation techniques while offering an in-depth performance benchmark analysis of actors based on their movie involvement and associated roles.
