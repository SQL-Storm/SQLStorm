This SQL query is designed to perform performance benchmarking involving various advanced SQL constructs. It includes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive title fetching, aggregates roles, and makes use of window functions to assign ranking to movies for each actor. It features complex predicates and conditional logic, incorporating `COALESCE` and `CASE` statements, and concludes the result set with a `UNION ALL` to include more interesting records pertaining to documentary roles based on obscure criteria. The edge cases in NULL handling and grouping enhance its complexity further.
