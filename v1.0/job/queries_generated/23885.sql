### Explanation:
1. **CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This recursive common table expression builds a hierarchy of movies and linked movies, characterizing them with keywords and their respective production years.
  
2. **DENSE_RANK**: This window function ranks each movie within its keyword category based on the production year, allowing for easy retrieval of movie rankings.

3. **JOINs and Aggregations**: The main query aggregates the results, counting distinct cast members and concatenating their names into a single string.

4. **CASE Statement**: This provides a custom description based on whether the movie has a rank.

5. **HAVING Clause**: Filters the final output to only include movies with a significant number of cast members.

6. **ORDER BY and FETCH**: The results are ordered by production year and a custom rank description, retrieving only the top 10 results. 

This query incorporates a range of SQL features, including common table expressions, window functions, recursive queries, outer joins, string aggregation, handling of NULL values, and complex conditional logic.
