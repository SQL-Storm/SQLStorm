### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Computes a ranking for every movie per year, allowing to filter out the top 5 movies for each production year.
   - `TopMovies`: Filters the top movies out of the ranked movies.
   - `MovieCast`: Aggregates names of casts for each movie.

2. **Subqueries**:
   - Counting action movies using a subquery within the main SELECT statement.
   - Counting box office information entries for each movie.

3. **Handling NULL Values**:
   - Using `COALESCE` to ensure that `cast_count` defaults to 0 and `cast_names` defaults to an empty array if no cast members are found.

4. **Array Aggregation**:
   - Utilizing `array_agg` to gather cast member names into an array for easier readability.

5. **String Matching with LIKE**:
   - Searching for action films using a LIKE operator within a subquery.

6. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - Ensures that the results are ordered chronologically by year, then titles alphabetically.

7. **Bizarre Semantics**:
   - The `OPTION (MAXDOP 1)` hint is included to specify parallel execution settings, which may result in unusual or unexpected behavior depending on the SQL server configuration and workload.

This query combines various SQL concepts in a practical yet elaborate manner, suitable for performance benchmarking in a complex schema.
