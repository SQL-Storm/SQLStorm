### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE** (`ActorHierarchy`): 
   - This helps in building a hierarchy of actors who have participated in movies since 2000. It tracks the level of participation.

2. **Select Statement**:
   - The main query aggregates various metrics of actors.
   - It counts distinct movies, aggregates movie titles, finds the latest movie year, calculates the average count of complete casts, counts the number of movies before 2010, and counts unique movie information.

3. **Joins**:
   - It utilizes INNER JOIN to associate actors with movies.
   - LEFT JOINs are used to include movie information even if some relationships (like `movie_info`) might not exist.

4. **Aggregations**:
   - The query uses COUNT, STRING_AGG for concatenation, AVG, SUM and COALESCE to safely handle possible NULL values.

5. **Filters**:
   - There is filtering to consider only movies produced after 2000 and separating those before 2010.

6. **Ordering and Limiting**:
   - Results are ordered by the number of movies and then by the latest movie year, limited to the top 10 actors.

This comprehensive query provides considerable insight into the performance of actors, leveraging complex SQL constructs for a benchmarking scenario.
