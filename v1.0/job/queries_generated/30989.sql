This SQL query provides a detailed performance benchmark by utilizing recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to build a hierarchy of movies, capturing the leading actor, their role, and keywords associated with the movies produced after the year 2000. The use of window functions for ranking the roles of actors enhances the complexity, and outer joins ensure that even if a movie doesn't have a leading actor or keywords, it still appears in the result set. The query is enriched with conditional logic to provide default values when no data is present.
