This SQL query includes:
- A recursive common table expression (CTE) that builds a hierarchy of movies based on linked movies.
- Multiple outer joins to gather data from various related tables including `cast_info`, `aka_name`, `movie_keyword`, and `movie_companies`, allowing for comprehensive insights.
- Conditional aggregation logic to compute the average order of cast members, and to count distinct keywords associated with each movie.
- String aggregation to compile a list of associated company names.
- Grouping on multiple dimensions to fulfill performance benchmarking with a HAVING clause to filter results based on a minimum criterion.
- Ordered results based on calculated metrics for further meaningful analysis.
