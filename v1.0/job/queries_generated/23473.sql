### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Ranks movies by the number of distinct cast members for each production year.
   - `TopRankedMovies`: Filters the top three ranked movies for each production year.
   - `MovieKeywordCounts`: Counts distinct keywords associated with movies.
   - `FinalResults`: Combines movie details with keyword counts and the number of cast members.

2. **Joins**:
   - Outer joins are employed to retain movies even if they do not have any associated keywords.

3. **Aggregations and Window Functions**:
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking and `COUNT()` functions for summation and distinct counts.

4. **NULL Logic**:
   - Utilizes `COALESCE()` to handle cases where a movie might have no associated keywords.

5. **Complicated Logic**:
   - Final selection includes a CASE statement to compare keyword and cast member counts, returning human-readable comparisons.

6. **Ordering**:
   - Results are ordered by production year and keyword count to present the most relevant data first.
