This query does the following:
- It ranks movies by the total number of unique cast members for each production year.
- It aggregates keywords associated with each movie.
- A final result set is generated to include additional distinctions based on cast size and exhibits peculiar logic for identifying associations with AKA names.
- The use of `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` addresses the challenge of displaying keywords while accounting for potential NULL values.
- The logic employed in filtering and ranking generates insights into the most prominent movies over the years.
