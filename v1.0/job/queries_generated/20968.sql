### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses multiple CTEs to break down the problem:
  - `RankedMovies` fetches movie titles and their production years, along with their rankings and counts per year.
  - `TopCast` retrieves cast information, ranking actors by their order in the cast list.
  - `MoviesWithTopCast` connects the two previous CTEs while filtering for movies with more than one entry per production year.
  - `FilteredMovies` further categorizes the role of actors by using a `CASE` statement.

- **Window Functions**: Row numbering and counting help categorize actors in the cast and total counts within different categories.

- **Complex Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause includes checks for nulls, specific conditions filtering out movies not produced after the year 2000 and ensuring that no movie companies associated with the movie have NULL notes.

- **String Expressions and Concatenation**: The final selection creates an elaborate string statement summarizing the movie's release and its lead cast.

- **Coalesce and Null Logic**: Uses `COALESCE` to provide default notes if the original note is null or empty.

- **Unusual or Obscure Semantics**: The usage of `LEFT JOIN` to include movies without casts and selecting using null-checking logic inside a correlated subquery introduces complexity.
