This SQL query performs a complex operation involving several elements:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `ActorHierachy` captures actors' hierarchies recursively, examining their roles and related actors.

2. **Complex Aggregation**: The `MovieTitles` CTE collects titles produced between 2000 and 2023, counting the number of actors and aggregating their names.

3. **Set Operators**: Uses LEFT JOIN to bring in keywords associated with the movies for deeper insights without excluding any titles.

4. **Complicated Predicates and NULL Logic**: Filtering responses by both a count of actors and specific production years while handling NULLs properly using `COALESCE`.

5. **Final Selection**: Gathers detailed output with conditions applied for display, sorted by production year and actor count.

6. **String Aggregation**: Constructs a string of actor names and keywords for easier readability in the results.

The query returns a structured list of movies, the number of actors involved, along with their names and keywords, providing detailed movie insights for performance benchmarking or analysis purposes.
