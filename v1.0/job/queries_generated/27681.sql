This SQL query benchmarks string processing by analyzing movies produced after 2000 that have more than five cast members. It ranks these movies by their cast count and retrieves the top movies along with the names of the actors and associated production companies. The `STRING_AGG` and `ARRAY_AGG` functions are leveraged for string processing and aggregation, providing a comprehensive view of the most populated films in terms of actors and production entities.
