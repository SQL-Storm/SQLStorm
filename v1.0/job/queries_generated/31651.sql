This SQL query showcases various advanced SQL constructs including a `WITH RECURSIVE` CTE to create a hierarchy of actors, multiple joins across different tables to gather information about movies, companies, and keywords. It also implements window functions, aggregation, filtering with calculated conditions, and string aggregation to compile keywords. Finally, the results are ordered to provide valuable insights into actors' filmographies and collaborations.
