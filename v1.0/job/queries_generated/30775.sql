### Explanation of the Query Constructs:
1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This Common Table Expression generates a hierarchy of movies, allowing us to see the links between movies over multiple levels.
2. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG` is used to concatenate titles of linked movies, providing a comprehensive view of associations.
3. **Window Functions**: The `COUNT` function with `OVER (PARTITION BY ak.id)` counts how many movies each actor is in, while maintaining performance.
4. **Left Joins**: Used to connect the primary tables with other relevant data while allowing for null values, especially in the context of links and notes.
5. **Complex Filters and CASE Statements**: Ensures that we filter out certain entries and compute derived values, such as the maximum order of cast members.
6. **Grouping and Ordering**: Results are grouped by actor and title, and ordered based on the count of movies and the highest order of the cast member, aiding easy analysis of data trends. 

This structure provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between actors and movies, including their connected titles, ensuring high performance and detailed insight for benchmarking queries.
