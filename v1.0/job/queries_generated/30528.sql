This SQL query performs an elaborate performance benchmarking on the `Join Order Benchmark` schema. It utilizes several advanced SQL constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE** (`movie_hierarchy`): Captures a hierarchy of movies, focusing on those produced after 2000.
2. **Window Function**: (`ROW_NUMBER()` in `cast_roles` CTE) to rank cast roles for each person.
3. **COALESCE**: To handle potential null values when joining.
4. **STRING_AGG**: To concatenate aliases for cast members.
5. **Aggregate Functions**: Count and average used for analysis.
6. **NULL Logic**: Handling nulls in notes and using `HAVING` to filter results based on conditions.
7. **Complex Grouping**: Grouping results by movie title and year while filtering for movies with multiple roles.

This will give insights into modern movies, especially their casts and associated roles, while benchmarking performance via various computations and joins.
