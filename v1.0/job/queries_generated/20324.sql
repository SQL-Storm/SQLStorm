This SQL query incorporates the following constructs and techniques:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** `ActorMovies`, `MovieKeywords`, `HighRatingMovies`, `FilteredActors`, and `FinalResults` to modularize the steps.
- **Correlated Subqueries:** Usage in filtering for movie information types and rating checks.
- **Window Functions:** `ROW_NUMBER()` to create a sequence of roles for different actors in their films.
- **Outer Joins:** Specifically `LEFT JOIN` to include movies without associated actor or keyword data.
- **Aggregation Functions:** `COUNT`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and `string_agg()` are used to count movies and concatenate strings.
- **Complicated Predicates:** Filtering conditions combining multiple levels of complexity.
- **String Expressions and NULL Logic:** `COALESCE` is used to handle NULL values effectively.
- **Set Operators:** Implicitly using `DISTINCT` to ensure uniqueness in counts and concatenated results.
- **Bizarre SQL Semantics:** Use of `CASE` for generating talent status based on unique movies count and high rating constraints. 

This query thus generates performance-related insights on actors based on their extensive appearances in high-rated movies while elegantly handling nulls and aggregating complex data relationships.
