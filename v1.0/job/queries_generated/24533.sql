This SQL query generates a hierarchical view of linked movies produced after the year 2000. Key features include recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create a movie hierarchy, outer joins to gather information from various associated tables like `cast_info` and `movie_keyword`, handling of NULLs in actor names, and the application of window functions for ordering by year. It also utilizes complex GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to filter results based on actor count and keyword presence. The selection of bizarrely structured string concatenation and title paths demonstrates advanced SQL capabilities, making this query both intricate and practical for performance benchmarking.
