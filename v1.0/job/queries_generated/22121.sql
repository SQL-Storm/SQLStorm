This complex SQL query does the following:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: It defines three CTEs (`RankedCast`, `ActorMovies`, and `FilteredMovies`) for organizing data about movie actors and their roles.
2. **Window Functions**: It utilizes `RANK()` and `COUNT()` to determine actor rankings and total counts per movie.
3. **Joins**: It performs both inner and left joins to gather information from multiple tables, including actor names, movie titles, and keywords.
4. **Filtering Criteria**: It filters actors with a rank of 3 or less and limits their appearances to movies with more than 5 actors.
5. **Aggregations**: It computes counts and averages, allowing for nuanced insights about actors and their movies.
6. **HAVING Clause**: It ensures that only movies with an average production year before 2000 are included in the secondary aggregation.
7. **Final Selection**: It selects records from `ActorMovies` and joins them to the `FilteredMovies` CTE based on specified conditions, applying an order and pagination (using OFFSET and FETCH) to refine the results.

This query explores obscure corner cases by using the COALESCE function to handle NULL values, as well as filtering and aggregation for unique insights into actors' filmography from the movie industryâ€™s metadata.
