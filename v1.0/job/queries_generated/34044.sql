This SQL query accomplishes the following:

1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: It builds a hierarchy of movies, allowing for the tracking of standalone movies and series based on production years.

2. **Window Function (`RANK()`)**: Used in the second CTE (`ranked_cast`) to rank the cast members of each movie based on their order of appearance (defined by `nr_order`).

3. **Aggregation using `ARRAY_AGG`**: In the `movie_keywords` CTE, this aggregates distinct keywords associated with each movie into an array.

4. **Outer Joins**: Combines the hierarchy of movies with cast information and movie keywords, allowing for possible NULL values when no cast or keywords are associated.

5. **Complicated predicates**: The `CASE` statement is used to designate whether the movie is a series or standalone based on its depth in the hierarchy.

6. **Group and Order**: The final query groups by movie attributes and orders by the production year and cast count for insightful benchmarking.
