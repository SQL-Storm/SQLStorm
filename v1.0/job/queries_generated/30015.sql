This SQL query does the following:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The recursive CTE `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies that are linked together (for example, sequels, remakes, etc.) and filters those from 2000 to 2023.

2. **Left Joins**: It uses LEFT JOINs to bring in keyword counts associated with movies, as well as details of the cast from the `cast_info` and `aka_name` tables.

3. **Aggregation**: It aggregates the total count of distinct keywords per movie and the total count of distinct actors in the cast. It concatenates actor names into a single string with `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Filtering**: The query filters the final results to only include movies that have more than five actors.

5. **Sorting**: The results are sorted by production year in descending order and then by keyword count in descending order.

This elaborate query combines multiple SQL features to analyze and benchmark the movie database effectively.
