This SQL query consists of several advanced constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` is a recursive common table expression that builds a hierarchy of movies produced from the year 2000 onwards, showing all linked movies recursively.

2. **Joins**: It utilizes multiple types of joins (inner and left joins) to gather relevant information about actors and the companies associated with movies.

3. **Aggregation**: The query calculates the number of distinct companies associated with each movie and collects their names using `COUNT` and `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` window function is used to rank the movies based on the number of associated companies, partitioning by the production year.

5. **String Manipulation**: The output includes concatenated company names using `STRING_AGG`.

6. **Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause checks for non-null actor names and filters the hierarchy to only the top level (where `level = 0`).

7. **HAVING clause**: This ensures that only movies with associated companies are included in the final result. 

This comprehensive query provides a deep performance benchmarking scenario by utilizing various SQL constructs, making it both complex and resource-intensive for testing purposes.
