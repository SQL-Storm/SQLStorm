This query performs a complex benchmarking analysis on a fictional film database, utilizing various SQL constructs as follows:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses three CTEs (`movie_appearances`, `qualified_actors`, `notable_movies`) to break down the logic into more manageable steps:

   - `movie_appearances` captures basic details about cast appearances, ordered by production year.
   - `qualified_actors` filters actors who have appeared in more than five movies, with conditions on their appearance years.
   - `notable_movies` identifies notable films from the year 2000 onwards that have a specific count of keywords.

2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function in `movie_appearances` ranks the appearances of actors based on the latest year.

3. **Correlated Subquery**: The subquery in the `WHERE` clause of the main query calculates the average keyword count for filtering notable movies.

4. **String Expressions and Complex Predicates**: Various conditions filter the data based on movie production year, valid roles, and the number of appearances.

5. **Set Operators and Outer Joins**: The LEFT JOIN in `notable_movies` allows capturing movies even if they have no associated keywords.

This efficiently creates a ranking of actors based on film appearances while correlating their roles with notable cinematic contributions using complex predicates and window functions.
