This SQL query accomplishes the following:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `movie_hierarchy` CTE generates a hierarchy of movies based on links to other movies that were produced after the year 2000. It tracks the depth of each movie in the hierarchy.

2. **Joins**: It combines multiple tables, including `cast_info`, `aka_name`, `movie_companies`, `aka_title`, `movie_keyword`, and `movie_info`, to extract rich information about actors, movies, companies involved in production, and keywords.

3. **Aggregation**: There are aggregate functions included, such as `COUNT` to count production companies and SUM to count notes in the `cast_info`.

4. **String Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to combine keywords into a single output column, providing a user-friendly representation of related keywords for each movie.

5. **Null Logic and Predicates**: The query incorporates predicates that ensure only non-null values are processed, which prevents potential issues related to data quality.

6. **Complicated Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters based on movie production year and the recursive level, demonstrating complex filtering logic.

7. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the number of production companies in descending order and then by actor names in ascending order, making the output meaningful and organized.

This comprehensive SQL query serves well for performance benchmarking, illustrating the capabilities of SQL with various constructs.
