This SQL query accomplishes the following tasks:
1. It collects data about movies, actors, roles, keywords associated with the movies, and companies involved.
2. It filters the movies to only include those released after the year 2000.
3. It ranks the movies based on the number of distinct actors per production year.
4. It selects the top 5 ranked movies per production year and organizes the output by the production year in descending order and the ranking of actors.

This will be useful for benchmark string processing within the context of the specified schema while providing rich insights about the movies and their associated entities.
