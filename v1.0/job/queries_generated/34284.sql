### Explanation:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: This is used to retrieve a hierarchy of titles, allowing for episodes and their parent series to be connected.

2. **CTE for Keywords (`TitleKeywords`)**: This gathers keywords for each movie, which can enhance understandability regarding the themes of the titles.

3. **CTE for Cast Profiles (`CastProfiles`)**: This ranks the cast members of each movie; NULL roles are filtered out to focus only on relevant actors.

4. **Main Query**: Combines the results from the CTEs and applies filters such as production year (â‰¥ 2000), level of episodes (top-level series only), and checks that the keywords include 'Action' or 'Drama' (or are NULL).

5. **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by production year in descending order and by title to provide relevant insights for performance benchmarking.

This query incorporates outer joins, correlated subqueries (through CTEs), recursive capabilities, complex filters, and diverse expressions to yield a rich dataset for benchmarking.
