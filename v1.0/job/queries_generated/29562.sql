This SQL query retrieves movies produced from the year 2000 onwards along with their details such as titles, production years, associated keywords, companies involved, and actors. It summarizes roles from the cast alongside their counts and then orders the final output by production year and the number of roles in descending order. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) creates a structured approach to modularize the query for better readability and efficiency.
