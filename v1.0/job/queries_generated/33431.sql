This SQL query accomplishes several advanced concepts:
1. It uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) `MovieHierarchy` to create a hierarchical structure of movies released after the year 2000, with an additional depth calculation.
2. It retrieves various aggregated metrics related to actors (`aka_name`), including the count of distinct movies they have appeared in and the average depth of those movies within the hierarchy.
3. It incorporates outer joins to acquire additional data from the `cast_info`, `movie_keyword`, and `person_info` tables, demonstrating NULL logic.
4. It utilizes window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to order the results within each actor grouping.
5. It aggregates keywords associated with each movie into a comma-separated string.
6. Complicated predicates are used, including a subquery to specify the `info_type` for personal information retrieval.

This makes the query overall quite elaborate and suitable for performance benchmarking across the various joins and aggregations presented.
