This SQL query utilizes advanced SQL concepts such as:

- A recursive common table expression (CTE) to create a hierarchy of movies linked to each other through the `movie_link` table.
- Various joins (including outer joins) to aggregate and combine information across numerous tables including `complete_cast`, `aka_name`, `role_type`, and `movie_keyword`.
- A set of computations such as counting distinct cast members and averaging roles based on a subquery.
- The use of `STRING_AGG()` to concatenate keywords associated with each movie.
- Conditional handling of NULL values through `COALESCE` and case statements.
- Grouping and ordering the results for a comprehensive benchmark on movie production since the year 2000.
