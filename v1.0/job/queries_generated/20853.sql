This SQL query showcases various constructs including common table expressions (CTEs), outer joins, conditional aggregations, window functions, and examines NULL logic. It performs a multi-faceted analysis of movies produced since 2000 by evaluating aspects like the cast's nature (named versus unnamed roles), the density of associated keywords, and overall movie rankings.
