This query retrieves a list of movies released after 2000 along with the names of actors, their roles, associated keywords, total number of actors in each movie, and the average length of additional information related to each movie. It showcases string processing through the use of `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords and `LENGTH` to compute the average length of movie information. The results are grouped by movie title and actor name, ensuring a well-organized output set.
