This SQL query retrieves a list of recent movies produced after the year 2000 that are associated with the keyword 'Drama', ranked by their title. It incorporates several advanced SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions for ranking and categorization, conditional statements, and NULL checks. The query also handles potential NULL values with COALESCE and provides an output that categorizes movies into 'Latest Movie', 'Recent Movie', and 'Older Movie' based on their production year rank, while indicating whether the movie has any associated award information.
