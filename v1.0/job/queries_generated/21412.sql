This SQL query involves multiple aspects- it utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the complex logic into manageable parts. The query performs ranking based on movie casts by production year, retrieves company details with a window function, aggregates keywords for each movie, and finally presents a comprehensive movie overview, handling possible NULLs and defaults throughout. The interplay between these CTEs showcases an unusual but interesting semantic approach to SQL querying.
