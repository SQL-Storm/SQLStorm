This SQL query performs a comprehensive performance benchmark combining various advanced constructs. The `WITH RECURSIVE` clause creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) to navigate movie relationships via links, building a hierarchy of movies. The main query subsequently joins multiple tables to retrieve detailed information about the movies, including cast lists, keywords, company associations, and aggregated values such as average ratings. The query adapts various SQL features such as string aggregation, conditional expressions, and NULL handling, while encapsulating complex logic with a focus on bizarre semantic usages. The result set also includes filtering through `HAVING` to ensure that only movies with multiple actors and above-average ratings are considered.
