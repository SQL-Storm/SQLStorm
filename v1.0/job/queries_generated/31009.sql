This SQL query performs the following:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: It creates a recursive CTE to gather all movies linked to a certain movie in a hierarchical manner.
2. **Joins**: It uses various inner joins and left joins to fetch data from related tables like `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `movie_companies`, and `movie_keyword`.
3. **COALESCE**: It utilizes the COALESCE function to provide a default value when there is no associated personal info.
4. **Window Function**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is employed to rank movies for each actor based on the recent production year.
5. **Case Statement**: It includes a case statement to handle NULL values in the `production_year` and provide a friendly display.
6. **GROUP BY and HAVING**: The query groups by various actor and movie attributes, filtering for actors associated with a significant number of keywords.

This query is ideal for performance benchmarking as it combines multiple SQL features and complex logic.
