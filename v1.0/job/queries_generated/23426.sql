This SQL query accomplishes the following:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It utilizes CTEs to structure the query. `RankedMovies` ranks movies by the count of their cast members per production year, `FilteredMovies` captures the top-ranked movies, and `KeywordCounts` gathers keywords associated with each movie.

2. **Outer Joins**: The query uses a LEFT JOIN to fetch movies that may or may not have keywords associated with them.

3. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` function is used to rank movies within their production years based on the cast count.

4. **Complicated Predicates**: It leverages `COALESCE` to handle NULL values in keyword counts, assigning a default of 0.

5. **String Expressions**: The CASE statements enrich the output with meaningful textual representations about the cast presence and keyword richness.

6. **NULL Logic**: It explicitly checks for NULL values in the production year to ensure that only valid productions are included in the result.

7. **Ordering**: The final result set is ordered by production year (descending) and then by cast count (descending), using `NULLS LAST` to place movies with no cast at the bottom of the list. 

This query is a comprehensive performance benchmarking exercise showcasing various SQL constructs and logic.
