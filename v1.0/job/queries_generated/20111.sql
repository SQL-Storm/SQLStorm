### Explanation:

1. **CTEs and Recursive Queries**: The query creates recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to sequentially derive data about movies and their actors.
   - The `movie_actors` CTE gathers the names of actors for each movie, assigning a rank to them.
   - The `actor_movies` CTE counts the number of actors for each movie and aggregates their names into a single string.

2. **Filtering & Joins**: Several joins filter the titles based on keywords with specific criteria (e.g., starting with "Action") while handling the possibility of NULL in the keyword table.

3. **CASE Statements**: Conditional expressions in `CAST` status and actor count category provide insights into the data dynamically.

4. **Outer Joins**: A LEFT JOIN between `selected_titles` and `actor_movies` helps to include movies without actors, showcasing SQLâ€™s NULL handling.

5. **Window Functions**: The use of ROW_NUMBER() and STRING_AGG() is a sophisticated way to manage and present data meaningfully.

6. **Final Output**: The query limits the final output to the top 10 movies sorted by production year descending and the number of actors, offering a comprehensive look at recent films with a significant cast.
