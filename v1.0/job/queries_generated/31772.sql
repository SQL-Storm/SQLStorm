This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)** called `movie_hierarchy` to create a hierarchy of movies linked by `movie_link` starting from movies produced after the year 2000.
   
2. **Joins** the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `title`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword` tables to gather data on actors and movies along with their associated keywords.

3. **Window Function** `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to assign a unique level number to each actorâ€™s movies based on their hierarchical depth in the movie linkage.

4. **Aggregate Function** `COUNT(DISTINCT kc.keyword)` counts unique keywords associated with each movie, filtering out entries without keywords.

5. **Conditional Logic** in the `WHERE` clause ensures that we only include movies and actors with valid values.

6. **Group By** helps to consolidate results by actor and movie with keyword counts.

7. **Order By** sorts the final output by actor name, descending hierarchy level and movie title for clarity in viewing the results.
