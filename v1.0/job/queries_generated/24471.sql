### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `ranked_movies`: Ranks movies by their production year based on the count of keywords.
   - `top_movies`: Selects the top 5 ranked movies per production year.
   - `cast_stats`: Aggregates cast information, getting counts and maximum role types.
   - `movie_details`: Joins various pieces of information about the top movies, includes string concatenation for cast information.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: Utilized to ensure that all relevant movies and their details are retained, even if some relationships (like cast or companies) do not exist.

3. **COALESCE/NULLIF for NULL Logic**: Used to handle potential NULLs for company names, replacing them with defaults.

4. **Window Functions**: Used to rank movies based on the number of associated keywords.

5. **CASE Statement**: Implements complex logic to categorize cast information based on role type and count.

6. **String Aggregation**: Concatenates strings for cast information, showcasing how multiple entries can be combined into a single output.

7. **Complicated Predicates**: Integrated in the CASE statement to provide a nuanced evaluation of cast details.

This query can be used for performance benchmarking by analyzing execution times for different database tuning scenarios, examining the efficiency of joins, aggregations, and how each component contributes to the overall runtime.
