This SQL query retrieves actors from the `aka_name` table, their corresponding movies from the `aka_title` table, and various other information tied to their roles and the movies they have appeared in. It includes recursive CTEs for obtaining hierarchical movie linking, window functions for ranking actors, and several joins to integrate keyword, company type, and personal information. Furthermore, it applies complex filtering criteria while demonstrating aggregation and string manipulation.
