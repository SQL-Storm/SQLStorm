This SQL query uses the following constructs:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The recursive CTE `MovieHierarchy` creates a hierarchy of movies linked through `movie_link`.
2. **Outer Join**: `LEFT JOIN` is used to include keywords even if some movies might not have associated keywords.
3. **Aggregations**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG` functions are used to summarize data.
4. **Null Logic**: The `CASE` statement handles NULL values in keywords, providing a fallback string.
5. **Complicated Predicates**: Filtering actors based on the number of movies and specific production years adds complexity.
6. **String Expressions**: `STRING_AGG` is utilized to create a comma-separated list of movie titles.

This query benchmarks the database performance while retrieving valuable insights regarding actors involved in numerous recent movies, along with their associated keywords.
