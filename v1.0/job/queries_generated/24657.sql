This elaborate SQL query performs the following:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) with Recursive Query**: It builds a hierarchy of movies and their linked movies, providing an opportunity to analyze movies with various levels of linkage.

2. **Selection of Actor and Movie Information**: The main query selects actor names from the `aka_name` table and their corresponding movie titles that they starred in within a specific time frame and type classification.

3. **Window Function**: It ranks movies based on the production year for each actor using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function.

4. **NULL Handling with COALESCE**: The query takes care of possible NULL values in the additional information provided about the movie.

5. **Conditional Logic in CASE Statements**: Different conditions check the existence of a year and the presence of the keyword 'Drama' in the movie's keywords.

6. **Search Functionality**: It includes a pattern matching condition for actor names using ILIKE for case-insensitive searching.

7. **Ordering of Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by the movie ranking and the actor's name for clarity.

This query encapsulates complexities in SQL constructs and caters to various logical requirements utilizing multiple features of SQL, which aids in performance benchmarking.
