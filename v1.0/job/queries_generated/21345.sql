### Description:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE named `movie_hierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies, distinguishing between episodes and parent titles.
  
2. **Joins**: 
   - The `aka_name` table is joined to `cast_info` to fetch the actor's details.
   - The `movie_hierarchy` CTE is joined to `cast_info` to relate actors to their relevant movies.
   - Left joins are performed on the `movie_keyword` and `keyword` tables to gather associated keywords.

3. **Aggregations**: 
   - It counts distinct movies an actor has been part of and aggregates those movie titles into an array.
   - It calculates the year of the latest movie an actor appeared in and counts `NULL` values in the `note` field of the `cast_info` table.

4. **Filtering & Grouping**:
   - Filters for actor names starting with 'A'.
   - Groups results by actor name while ensuring only those with either more than 5 movies or with a `NULL` production year are selected.

5. **Ordering & Limiting**: The final results are ordered by the last movie's year and limit the output to the top 10 results. 

This query incorporates string manipulation, NULL handling, and employs advanced SQL constructs for intricate data retrieval and performance benchmarking.
