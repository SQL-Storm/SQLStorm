This SQL query consists of the following components:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `MovieHierarchy`: A recursive CTE that builds a hierarchy of movies linked together (up to 2 levels of links) from 2000 onwards.
   - `RankedMovies`: A CTE that counts the unique keywords associated with each movie and ranksÂ the movies within each production year based on this count.
   - `ActorMovies`: A CTE that summarizes the roles played by actors in each movie.

2. **JOINs**:
   - Outer joins to include movies even if they don't have associated keywords or actors.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - To partition and rank the movies based on the number of distinct keywords.

4. **NULL Handling**:
   - Use of `CASE` statements to provide user-friendly output when actors have no roles linked to the movie.

5. **Complicated predicates**:
   - Multiple `JOIN` conditions including linking movies to their actors and keywords while using conditions in the `WHERE` clause. 

This query showcases a variety of SQL concepts and is designed for performance benchmarking across a complex dataset.
