### Explanation:
1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: 
   - A recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`) is defined to fetch all movies from 2000 onwards and explore their links up to three levels deep.
   
2. **Joins**: 
   - The main query fetches data using various joins:
     - An inner join with `complete_cast` to count the total cast members.
     - Left joins with `cast_info` and `aka_name` to gather actor names and handle potentially nullable values for notes.

3. **Aggregations and Calculations**:
   - The query computes the total number of cast members and concatenates distinct actor names using `STRING_AGG`.
   - It calculates a ratio for null checks on the `note` field in `cast_info`.
   - It pulls unique keywords related to each movie.

4. **GROUP BY and HAVING**:
   - The results are grouped by movie title, and only those that have more than five cast members are retained.

5. **Sorting and Limiting Output**:
   - The results are ordered by the latest production year and the total cast size, with a limit to the top ten results.

This query structure is complex, incorporating various SQL features to meet the requirements of performance benchmarking tasks.
