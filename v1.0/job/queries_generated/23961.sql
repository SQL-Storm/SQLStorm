This SQL query involves several advanced concepts:
1. **CTEs**: Multiple Common Table Expressions to structure the query and handle complex transformations.
2. **Window Functions**: Use of `ROW_NUMBER()` and `COUNT(DISTINCT)` for ranking and counting cast members.
3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Using a subquery to filter movies based on the average count of cast.
4. **String Manipulation**: Leveraging `REGEXP_REPLACE()` to apply pattern transformation on movie titles.
5. **COALESCE**: To handle NULL values and provide fallback strings.
6. **Conditional Logic**: Utilizing CASE for rank classification.
7. **Outer Joins**: Employing LEFT JOINs to gather additional information even if movies have no related info.
8. **Bizarre SQL Semantics**: The query plays with rank numbers and titles to introduce unconventional conditions and results.

The structure of the query allows for performance benchmarking by analyzing the execution time and resources used for each complex SQL operation performed.
