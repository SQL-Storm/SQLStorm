### Explanation:
- **Recursive CTE (ActorHierarchy)**: This identifies all actors whose names begin with 'A', allowing for hierarchical exploration of their relationships based on their movie roles.
- **Left Joins**: Used to include actors who may not have acted in any movies after 2000, along with their movies and rankings.
- **Window Function**: `RANK()` is utilized to assign ranks based on the production year of the movies, enabling detailed analysis of their performances over time.
- **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` aggregates titles of movies into a single string per actor, making output more readable.
- **Aggregation Functions**: The use of `COUNT()` for counting movies and `AVG()` for the average ranking of movies contributes to performance benchmarking by summarizing data in an insightful manner.
- **Handling NULLs**: `COALESCE` is applied to provide a default value for production years when they are NULL, resulting from outer joins.

This query encapsulates complex SQL constructs suitable for performance benchmarking and offers insights into actor contributions over the years.
