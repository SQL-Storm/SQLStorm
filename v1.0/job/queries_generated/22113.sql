This SQL query encompasses a variety of constructs for performance benchmarking, including CTEs for organizing the workflow into logical steps, window functions to calculate ranking, outer joins to include records even if corresponding records are missing, aggregate functions with complicated predicates, and even a final selection to check for corner cases in actor availability. It serves as an elaborate demonstration of SQL capabilities tailored for performance benchmarks in the defined schema.
