This SQL query performs the following functions:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE):** It uses a recursive CTE `movie_hierarchy` to find movies produced from the year 2000 onwards and imagines generating a sequel for each movie, creating a hierarchy.
  
2. **Joins:** It performs joins between multiple tables including `title`, `cast_info`, and `aka_name`.

3. **Aggregation Functions:** It calculates the total number of distinct casts per movie and counts how many entries have non-null notes.

4. **Window Functions:** The query uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign a unique row number for each movie within its production year.

5. **Complex HAVING Clause:** Only movies with more than one cast member are selected.

6. **Order By Clause:** Finally, results are ordered by production year in descending order and then by movie ID.

This query can be useful for performance benchmarking when working with complex SQL constructs.
