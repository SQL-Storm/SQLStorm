### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Computes a ranking of movies based on the number of distinct cast members, grouping by the year.
   - `HighlightedMovies`: Filters the top 5 movies for each production year, categorizing them as 'Popular' or 'Less Known'.
   - `MovieKeywords`: Gathers keywords associated with the movies.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the highlighted movies with their keywords.
   - Counts the total number of movies per year.
   - Uses a `COALESCE` along with a `SUM` to count how many of those movies have the keyword 'action' in a case-insensitive manner.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - Utilizes window functions to rank movies and count the number of movies per year.

4. **Outer Joins & Aggregate Functions**:
   - The outer join with `MovieKeywords` ensures that even if a movie does not have keywords, it is still included in the result.

5. **Complicated Predicates and NULL Logic**:
   - The use of `FILTER` with `STRING_AGG` and combined conditions using `COALESCE` illustrates handling NULL values in aggregate calculations.

6. **String Expressions and Filters**:
   - Using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive keyword matching, and formatting the actorsâ€™ names into a concatenated string.

This SQL query is structured for performance benchmarking by using aggregates and complex joins while providing insightful movie data from the given schema.
