### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Recursive CTE (movie_hierarchy)**: This part creates a hierarchy of movies, starting with those produced in or after 2000, and allows us to find linked movies recursively.

2. **Joins**: 
   - The query joins multiple tables: `aka_name` for actors, `cast_info` for their roles, `aka_title` for movie titles, `movie_keyword` for keywords associated with those movies, and `movie_info` for genre information where applicable.
   - A left join on `movie_info` is utilized to handle cases where some movies might not have genre entries.

3. **Calculation of Aggregates**: 
   - Counts of keywords and roles are calculated. 
   - An average note length is computed where `NULL` values are treated distinctly.
   - A string aggregation function (`STRING_AGG`) collects unique keywords.

4. **Window Function**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is applied to rank the actors based on their keyword frequency.
   
5. **Filters**: 
   - Various predicates are included to filter out actors with non-null names only.
   - The movies must be produced after 2010 or lack a specific `kind_id`.
   - Additional conditions ensure the movie meets certain criteria before counting keywords.

6. **Final Grouping and Ordering**: Finally, results are grouped by actor and movie, and ordered by keyword count and actor name for easier readability.

This query is complex and demonstrates various SQL concepts, making it well-suited for performance benchmarking.
