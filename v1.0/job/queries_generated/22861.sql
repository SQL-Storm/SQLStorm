### Explanation:
- **WITH RecursiveMovies**: A recursive common table expression (CTE) that builds a hierarchy of connected movies from the dataset starting from those produced after the year 2000.
- **LEFT JOINs**: To assemble data from multiple tables while allowing for NULL entries for movies without associated actors, companies, or keywords.
- **GROUP_CONCAT**: To concatenate actor names into a single string for each movie, which illustrates aggregate data retrieval.
- **COUNT with CASE**: To count the number of distinct companies unassociated with movies and female cast members.
- **MAX with CASE**: Checks if a company type exists for given movies.
- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Applies window function to rank movies by the count of keywords associated.
- **HAVING clause**: Filters the aggregated results ensuring only movies with more than five actors and specific name codes are shown.
- **ORDER BY and OFFSET/FETCH**: To impose pagination on the results ensuring only the first batch is returned. 

This query is intricate and explores various SQL constructs, including recursive queries, window functions, and advanced aggregation logic.
