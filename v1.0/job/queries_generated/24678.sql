This SQL query incorporates various SQL constructs:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for intermediate calculations.
- Outer joins and a full outer join to gather data across potentially non-matching records.
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`) for ordering and ranking within groups.
- Aggregation with `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords.
- Complicated predicates with conditions checking for NULL values and results of convoluted join operations.
- Usage of OFFSET and FETCH for pagination. 

The overall structure allows for performance benchmarking across the data model by fetching relevant movie, actor, keyword, and company information based on specific conditions while efficiently managing data relations and anomaly checks during joins.
