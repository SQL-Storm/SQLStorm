This SQL query performs the following operations:

1. It creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) `RankedMovies` to filter movies produced between 2000 and 2023, grouping them by movie title and production year, while counting the distinct cast members for each movie.
2. Another CTE `PopularActors` retrieves actors who have starred in more than 5 movies, counting their appearances.
3. The `MovieKeywords` CTE aggregates keywords associated with each movie.
4. Finally, it combines the information from these CTEs to retrieve the movie title, production year, cast count, popular actor names, and associated keywords, sorted by production year and cast count. 

**Note**: Join conditions can be further refined based on actual relationship logic, as some dummy joins were used here to illustrate data retrieval across the provided schema.
