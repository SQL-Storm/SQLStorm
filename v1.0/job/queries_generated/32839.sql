### Explanation of Constructs Used:
1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies produced after 2000 and includes link relationships between them.
2. **LEFT JOINs**: Multiple joins link together the various tables to gather relevant data about movies, complete casts, and actor names.
3. **Aggregate Functions**: These are used to count distinct cast members and concatenate actor names into a single string, along with using `MAX` and `MIN` to retrieve birth and death dates.
4. **Conditional Aggregation**: This allows for filtering values based on the `info_type_id`.
5. **HAVING Clause**: Filters to find movies where the average age of actors is greater than 30 years.
6. **ORDER BY and LIMIT**: Orders the results based on the number of cast members and limits the output to the top 10 results for performance benchmarking.
