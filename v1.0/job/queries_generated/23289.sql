This SQL query performs a variety of complex operations to benchmark performance using different SQL constructs:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: To rank titles by year and to count actors' movies.
- **Window Functions**: Such as `ROW_NUMBER()` to order data for titles and actor counts.
- **Left Joins**: To include actors even if they have not acted in any titles.
- **String Aggregation**: To combine multiple keywords associated with movies.
- **NULL Logic**: Using `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values for company types.
- **Compound HAVING Clause**: To filter results based on the presence of keywords or company types.

The use of various SQL elements and constructs not only expands the complexity of the query but also adds performance benchmarking capability by measuring the aggregation and joining processes across many tables.
