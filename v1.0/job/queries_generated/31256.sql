This SQL query performs several complex operations suitable for performance benchmarking, including:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: It creates a hierarchy of movies linked through `movie_link`, filtering for movies produced after 2000.
2. **Joins**: It uses various types of joins, including inner joins for `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `aka_title`, and left joins for `movie_companies` and `movie_keyword`.
3. **Window Function**: It incorporates `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank movies for each actor by production year.
4. **Conditional Logic**: It uses a `CASE` expression to provide a user-friendly display of the production year.
5. **Aggregation**: It counts distinct keywords associated with the movies, allowing for selection based on keyword criteria.
6. **Predicate Conditions**: It filters records based on the validity of names and production years.
7. **Order and Grouping**: It sorts the final output by actor name and movie rank, providing a meaningful structure to the results. 

This comprehensive query structure is well-suited for evaluating database performance under a variety of conditions encompassed in the schema's tables and relationships.
