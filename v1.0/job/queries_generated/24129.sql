This SQL query performs a multi-faceted analysis of people associated with a series of movies, emphasizing their connections and the network of films in which they are involved. It utilizes several advanced SQL constructs: 

- A recursive common table expression (`WITH RECURSIVE`) to trace movie links.
- Multiple joins to extract information from numerous related tables.
- Window functions (`COUNT(...) OVER(...)`) to get a count of distinct movies for each person.
- String aggregation to compile keywords related to movies.
- Filtering and selection criteria to embrace or reject data based on specified rules (e.g., excluding certain conditions with `COALESCE`).
- Ordered results to present a comprehensible format, showcasing the number of links succinctly.

This achieves a comprehensive performance benchmark, while also illustrating complicated SQL grammar and behavior.
