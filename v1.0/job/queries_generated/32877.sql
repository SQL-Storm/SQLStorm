This SQL query uses:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For recursive movie hierarchy and summary statistics.
2. **Recursive Queries**: To gather series and episode relationships.
3. **Aggregations**: Counting roles and calculating average ratings.
4. **Window Functions**: Ranking movies based on their average rating.
5. **Outer Joins**: To ensure we gather all movies even if there are no roles or ratings.
6. **COALESCE**: Handling NULLs for ratings and role counts.
7. **Complex Predicates**: Filtering movies based on the production year and using conditional logic for ratings. 

This structure allows for a comprehensive performance benchmark of retrieving significant data across interconnected tables while maintaining a focus on recent and relevant movie data.
