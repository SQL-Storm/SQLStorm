### Explanation:

1. **CTEs**: 
   - `actor_movies`: Fetches actors and their movies, ranked by production year.
   - `movie_keywords`: Aggregates keywords associated with movies.
   - `company_info`: Extracts production companies for each movie.

2. **Joins**: 
   - Several `JOIN`s retrieve data across multiple tables, ensuring both inner and outer joins are included.
  
3. **COALESCE**: Handles NULL values for keywords and company names, providing default text.

4. **Window Functions**: 
   - `ROW_NUMBER` ranks movies for each actor.
   - `COUNT(*) OVER` counts total movies and how many times actors worked with multiple companies.

5. **Complex Predicate Logic**: The main `SELECT` filters to only show movies post-2000 or those without a year.

6. **UNION ALL**: Demonstrates a corner case by adding an empty result set containing a placeholder to handle the situation when no data meets the criteria.

7. **Keywords and Company Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG` for collecting keywords associated with each movie.

This elaborate query serves performance benchmarking while demonstrating complex SQL semantics.
