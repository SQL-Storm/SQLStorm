This SQL query demonstrates various concepts, including:
- A recursive CTE named `MovieHierarchy` that supposedly builds a hierarchy of movies and their roles.
- A second CTE (`FilteredMovies`) that aggregates data and ranks movies by the number of distinct cast members per year.
- Uses window functions (RANK) to provide further insight into the rankings.
- Edges in on NULL logic via COALESCE and NULLIF to handle potential zeroes in role_ids.
- Templates for potential expansion, such as a self-join in the recursive part, which can symbolize relationships, and additional keywords associated with movies are gathered in the final selection.
- The final selection includes a filter on the cast count and orders results, thereby simulating performance queries.
