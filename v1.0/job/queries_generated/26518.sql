This SQL query performs several operations to benchmark string processing within the Join Order Benchmark schema. It begins with a Common Table Expression (CTE) that ranks movies based on their cast count and aggregates alternate names and keywords. It further processes this data to attach rating information, cleans up that data, and finally filters and orders the results for an optimal final output. The results include a derived column indicating whether each movie is 'Rated' or 'Unrated'.
