This SQL query generates a performance benchmark based on a recursive common table expression (CTE) to create a movie hierarchy, joins various relevant tables to gather data about each movie, such as its title, production year, associated persons, keywords, and ratings. It employs window functions, aggregates with `COALESCE` to deal with potential NULL values, and uses `STRING_AGG` to collect keywords effectively. The query also filters out movies with a cast count of one or fewer, ensuring only those with more substantial support are included in the results.
