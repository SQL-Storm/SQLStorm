This SQL query demonstrates an interesting combination of various advanced SQL constructs. The main components are:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `movie_hierarchy` to retrieve linked movies starting from films released after 2000, allowing for a depth of links (up to 5 levels).
  
2. **Aggregation with `STRING_AGG`**: `cast_summary` to get the total number of distinct cast members and list their names for each movie.

3. **Left Joins**: to combine movie information with potential keywords and additional details, allowing for NULL handling.

4. **Complicated Predicates**: Filtering out movies that have no production year or zero cast members.

5. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by production year (most recent first) and movie title. 

This query should provide comprehensive insights suitable for performance benchmarking in complex SQL scenarios.
