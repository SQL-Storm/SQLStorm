This SQL query is constructed to benchmark string processing by retrieving the top 10 movies produced after 2000, ranked by the number of distinct cast members. It aggregates names and keywords, demonstrating both string aggregation and filtering capabilities in SQL. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) facilitates a clear structure and enhances readability.
