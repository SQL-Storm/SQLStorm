This SQL query snippets include the following key features:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate information from the various tables, specifically joining `aka_title`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`, and `movie_keyword` to gather movie details, casting information, and associated keywords.
- A filtering condition to only include movies produced from the year 2000 onwards.
- The query uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate actor names and keywords for each movie in a readable format.
- A `RANK()` function is employed to rank the movies based on the count of cast members, allowing for easy selection of the top movies.
- The final selection retrieves the top 10 movies based on the number of cast members, listing the title, production year, cast count, actors, and keywords.
