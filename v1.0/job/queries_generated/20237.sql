This SQL query demonstrates a combination of complex SQL features, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, correlated subqueries, and various join types. Additionally, it allows for usages such as `STRING_AGG` for string aggregation, and `COALESCE` for handling NULLs, making it quite versatile for performance benchmarking. The conditions in the WHERE clause include corner cases to ensure a range of results from varying contexts.
