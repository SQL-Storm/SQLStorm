This SQL query includes several complex constructs: 

1. **Recursive CTE:** `movie_hierarchy` to build a hierarchy of linked movies starting from titles produced in or after the year 2000.
2. **LEFT JOINs:** To fetch cast information, keywords, companies, and movie info.
3. **STRING_AGG:** To concatenate actor names into a single string.
4. **ARRAY_AGG:** To collect distinct roles into an array.
5. **FILTER Clauses:** To apply conditions on counts and aggregations.
6. **COALESCE:** To provide a fallback message when no actors are found.
7. **GROUP BY:** To group the results by movies while maintaining details about actor statistics and other information.
8. **ORDER BY and LIMIT:** To control output and sort results effectively.

This query can serve as a benchmark for performance as it involves multiple joins, aggregations, and a recursive structure.
