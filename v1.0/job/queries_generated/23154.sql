This SQL query performs a performance benchmark on a fictional movie database by constructing a recursive common table expression (CTE) to evaluate movie hierarchies, then joining information about actors and their respective movies using aggregate functions. It also incorporates complex predicates, NULL logic, and various string operations while carefully handling outer joins and window functions to maintain accurate statistics and rankings, thus showcasing the intricate relationships and data structures within the benchmark schema.
