This SQL query does the following:
- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to classify movies into hierarchical structures based on episode relationships, extract actor info with a window function to find the most recent movie per actor, identifies popular movies with a minimum actor count, and aggregates keywords for each movie.
- Constructs several complex logical joins and filters with outer joins, correlated subqueries, and set operations.
- Incorporates NULL handling and uses string aggregation to return comma-separated keywords for each movie, alongside actor names and movie details.
- Finally, sorts results based on the production year and actor name, revealing a nested or layered reporting structure that's more intriguing for performance benchmarking.
