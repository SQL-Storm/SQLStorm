This SQL query aims to perform an elaborate benchmark by joining multiple complex tables while demonstrating the use of common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, string aggregation, and various logical constructs. The recursive CTE `RecursiveCast` captures the casting information, and several other CTEs calculate statistics on movies, keywords, and companies. The final selection filters the data with complicated predicates, handling potential NULL values thoughtfully.
