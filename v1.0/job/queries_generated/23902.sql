In this SQL query:
- We use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to build a recursive hierarchy of movies.
- We utilize a correlated subquery within the CTE to count incomplete casts and categorize movies based on the presence of associated information.
- A window function `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to partition the results by production year.
- Another CTE to rank movies by status and then filter out results where the status is 'Complete' or 'No Info'.
- An outer join is implied through the aggregation function `STRING_AGG` to compile names of cast members, accounting for NULL values using `COALESCE`.
- Finally, we apply pagination using `OFFSET` and `FETCH NEXT` to limit the output to a specific number of results, creating a layered and complex SQL structure useful for performance benchmarking.
