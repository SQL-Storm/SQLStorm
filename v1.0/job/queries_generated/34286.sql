### Explanation of Query Constructs:
1. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE generates a hierarchical representation of movies from 2000 onward and their linked movies.
  
2. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - `COUNT()` is used to count the number of cast members for each movie.
   - `STRING_AGG()` aggregates distinct actor names into a single string.
   - `AVG()` calculates the ratio of female actors and the average length of movie info entries.

3. **Left Joins**: Multiple left joins connect various tables ensuring we capture movies with or without related data.

4. **Case Statements**: Used to determine and calculate the female ratio.

5. **Group By**: The results are grouped by movie title and production year, allowing us to aggregate the data meaningfully.

6. **Order By**: Orders the results by average info length and cast count, allowing for insightful benchmarking.

7. **Limit**: Restricts the output to the top 10 results based on specified criteria. 

By leveraging the above constructs, this query is both complex and useful for performance benchmarking in a multi-table environment.
