### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - The first CTE `RankedMovies` filters titles of movies from `aka_title` with a `kind_id` reflecting films, organizes them by `production_year`, and counts the number of cast members.
   - The second CTE `MoviesWithKeywords` aggregates keywords associated with each movie.
   - The third CTE `HighRatedMovies` computes the average rating of movies whose average rating exceeds 7.
   - The fourth CTE `FinalSelections` combines the movie titles with their keywords and ratings.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Selects movies with keys from `FinalSelections`, joins to find the directorâ€™s name, and provides a comment based on the existence of an average rating.
   - Uses `COALESCE` for null checks on director names and a `CASE` statement to customize the rating comment.

3. **Additional Constructs**:
   - The query embodies various SQL constructs like string aggregation, windowing functions, joins, correlated subqueries, and logical conditions.
   - It also demonstrates unusual semantics by implying relationships (like directors from actors) and includes edge cases that consider nullability, which might not always align as expected.
