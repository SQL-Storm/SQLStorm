In this SQL query:

1. **Recursive CTE** `MovieHierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies, starting from those produced after the year 2000 and including their linked movies.
2. The main query selects the movie titles, their production years, the actorâ€™s names, the count of production companies associated with each movie, and accumulates keywords in a comma-separated format.
3. `RANK()` is utilized to rank movies based on the number of associated companies.
4. `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if there is no associated actor or company, the movie will still be included in the results.
5. `HAVING` filters the results to include only those movies associated with more than 5 companies.
6. Finally, the results are ordered by production year and the rank of each movie.
