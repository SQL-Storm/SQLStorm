### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - The first CTE `MovieHierarchy` recursively builds the hierarchy of movies linked together through their relationships.
   - The second CTE `AggregatedData` gathers additional information about each movie in the hierarchy, such as the number of cast members and keywords associated with each movie, using `LEFT JOIN` to include movies without cast.

2. **Window Functions**: The `RANK()` function is used to rank movies within the same level based on the number of cast members.

3. **CASE Statement**: This conditional logic classifies the cast quality based on the count of cast members, allowing for textual categorization of the movies.

4. **String Aggregation**: `STRING_AGG()` is used to combine all keywords associated with each movie into a single string.

5. **Filtering**: The final selection filters for movies produced between 2010 and 2022.

6. **Ordering**: The final result is ordered by movie level and total cast members in descending order. 

This complex query is designed to benchmark performance while utilizing multiple SQL constructs effectively.
