### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: This CTE ranks movies within their production years based on their IDs to identify top movies per year.
   - `TopRatedActors`: This identifies actors who have appeared in more than 5 movies, emphasizing those with a leading role (indicated by `nr_order`).
   - `KeywordStats`: This collects keyword statistics for movies, including count and aggregation.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The main query selects movie titles, production years, actor names, movie counts, and keywords, joining data from the CTEs and including actor information with a null fallback using `COALESCE`.

3. **Join Logic**:
   - An outer join with `TopRatedActors` filters the top actors, allowing for potentially NULL entries (actors who don't relate to any movies).
   - It aggregates keywords, showcasing distinct keywords related to each movie.

4. **Filtering and Ordering**:
   - It restricts results to movies produced after 2000 and allows for potential ranking on actor reputation.
   - Finally, results are ordered by production year descending, then by counts, ensuring clarity and focus on relevant results.

This SQL query merges multiple complex constructs and nuances, providing a robust benchmark scenario for performance and query complexity analysis.
