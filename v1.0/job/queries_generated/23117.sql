This elaborate SQL query does the following:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Counts the number of actors in each movie and ranks movies by that count within their production year.
   - `PopularMovies`: Filters to select movies that had the maximum number of actors in their respective years.
   - `MovieKeywords`: Retrieves all keywords associated with movies produced after the year 2000 and aggregates them into a comma-separated string.
   - `CompanyInfo`: Gathers all companies associated with each movie, aggregating their names and types.

2. **Main Query**: Joins `PopularMovies` with the `MovieKeywords` and `CompanyInfo` to get a comprehensive view of the most popular movies along with keyword and company information. It handles NULL values gracefully with COALESCE and provides a meaningful output string for the production year.

3. **ORDER BY**: Orders results by production year in descending order to list the most recent popular movies at the top.

4. **String Expressions and NULL Logic**: The query utilizes string aggregation, case statements, and COALESCE to manage potential NULL values, providing clear outputs even when data is missing.
