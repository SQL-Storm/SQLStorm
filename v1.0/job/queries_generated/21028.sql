This SQL query exemplifies performance benchmarking by incorporating CTEs, recursive CTEs, outer joins, correlated subqueries, string expressions, and complex conditions including null checks. It specifically measures interesting aspects of movie titles related to their production and distribution by different companies while counting distinct actors and calculating unique character attributes of names associated with the movies. The filtering criteria focus on production years post-2000 and constraints on actor counts, leading to a narrowed dataset that can be useful for performance evaluations.
