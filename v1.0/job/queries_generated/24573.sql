This SQL query builds upon the provided schema by using CTEs to first rank movies, filtering them based on specific conditions, and then producing a final output that aggregates additional data about cast members. It employs window functions, correlated subqueries, and uses both regular and NULL handling techniques to handle the various potential states of records across the tables. Moreover, it involves complex expressions and predicates, making it richer and more aligned with the request for performance benchmarking.
