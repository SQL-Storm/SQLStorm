### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
  - `RankedMovies`: Ranks movies by production year and calculates the count of cast members for each movie.
  - `PersonDetails`: Aggregates the count of movies participated by each actor while concatenating the titles into a comma-separated string, excluding NULL names.
  - `MovieKeywords`: Counts the occurrences of keywords for each movie.

- **Joins and Filters:**
  - LEFT JOINs are used to connect the movies, actors, and keywords while allowing for movies to appear even if they don't have associated actors or keywords.

- **Complicated Predicates:**
  - The WHERE clause checks for non-null production years and actor names and filters for movies with a rank of 5 or lower and at least one actor that has participated in more than one movie.

- **Window Functions:**
  - Utilizes ROW_NUMBER() to rank and COUNT() to determine the number of participants.

- **Set Operators:**
  - Although not explicitly used here, the query structure sets the foundation for potential UNION operations should one wish to combine different datasets.

- **NULL Logic:**
  - The use of COALESCE ensures that keyword counts default to zero if no keywords were found.

- **String Expressions:**
  - STRING_AGG aggregates movie titles into a single string for each actor. 

This SQL query aims to fetch a select few of the top movies (loosely defined here as the top 5 of each production year), highlight the active participants, and provide a summary of related keywordsâ€”all while handling complex relationships and potential NULLs.
