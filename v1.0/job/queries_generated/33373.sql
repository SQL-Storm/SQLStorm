This SQL query is structured to perform a complex analysis on a schema pertaining to a film database. It uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) to create a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, considers multiple joins (including left joins), aggregates data with window functions, handles NULL logic, and incorporates a range of filtering criteria and groupings. The results display actors with their movie titles, production years, hierarchy levels, associated keywords, the number of cast members, and the total budget. The final output is ordered by budget and levels in the movie hierarchy, providing insights into relational movie data.
