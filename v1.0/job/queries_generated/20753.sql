This SQL query performs various advanced operations using the provided table schema. It constructs a hierarchical representation of titles, counts distinct movies associated with actors, identifies the top actors based on movie counts, and includes keyword counts for movies. The final output filters results based on specified conditions, including a bizarre combination of NULL checks and complex predicates.
