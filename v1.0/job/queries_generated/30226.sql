This SQL query does the following:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE named `movie_hierarchy` builds a hierarchy of movies based on their linkage through `movie_link`. It starts with feature films and finds linked movies, building a depth level field.

2. **Main Query**: The main query involves:
   - Joining `cast_info` to find roles played by actors.
   - Joining to `aka_name` to fetch actor names.
   - Joining the recursive CTE `movie_hierarchy` to filter by movies produced after 2000.
   - Using `LEFT JOIN` to gather additional information about the person from `person_info` while handling potential NULL values with `COALESCE`.
   - Counting distinct keywords associated with each movie using `LEFT JOIN` on `movie_keyword` and `keyword`.

3. **Filtering and Grouping**: The results filter actors who have contributed to more than two distinct keywords associated with their movies from 2000 onwards and groups by actor and movie for summary output.

4. **Window Function**: A window function (`ROW_NUMBER()`) is utilized to rank the movies per actor by production year.

5. **Final Ordering**: The results are then ordered by movie rank and actor name.

This complex query is designed for performance benchmarking, testing the effectiveness and efficiency of joining multiple tables, the utility of recursive structures, and the proper handling of NULLs, all while providing insightful data.
