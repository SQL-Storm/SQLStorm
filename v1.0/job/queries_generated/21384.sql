This SQL query demonstrates various advanced features such as:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive movie hierarchy representation.
- Outer joins to link various entities with appropriate fallback logic (e.g., COALESCE).
- Correlated subqueries to count keywords related to each movie.
- SQL window functions for numbering rows within partitions.
- Grouping with HAVING to filter based on conditions applied to aggregates.
- Complicated predicates to steer clear of certain conditions while maintaining flexibility with NULL logic.

This query can serve as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of various SQL constructs in conjunction with larger datasets derived from the schema provided.
