### Explanation:
1. **RecursiveGenre CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) retrieves the genres of the movies along with their production years.

2. **RankedMovies CTE**: This CTE ranks movies based on their genres and production years, using `ROW_NUMBER()` which resets for each genre, allowing us to filter later.

3. **MovieCast CTE**: It computes the total distinct cast members and the average length of notes for each movie, grouping by `movie_id`.

4. **TopMovies CTE**: Joins the previously created CTEs to get the top ranked movies based on the genre and their respective cast information.

5. **Final Select**: Produces a detailed list of top movies with:
   - The title and year of release.
   - Case statements to handle the situations where the cast is empty or average note length is null.
   - Correlated subqueries to count distinct actors and gather their names into a comma-separated list.

6. **Order**: The results are ordered by the production year in descending order, with null values for `total_cast` appearing last. 

### Advanced Features:
- Recursive CTE to aggregate movie genres.
- Use of window functions for ranking.
- Conditional logic with CASE and COALESCE to handle NULL values.
- Subqueries to derive extra information specifically related to cast members. 
- String aggregation to concatenate actor names efficiently. 

This query demonstrates a rich combination of SQL constructs, showing how complex data relationships can be navigated within the provided schema.
