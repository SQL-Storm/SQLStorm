This SQL query utilizes various constructs, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize subqueries, window functions for ranking movies by their titles, and correlated subqueries to gather keywords and actor roles associated with each movie. It performs filtering based on production years and the number of actors involved, showcasing complex predicates and NULL handling with `COALESCE`. Furthermore, it presents multi-level aggregation, leveraging both CTEs and nested queries while maintaining clarity and structure for potential performance benchmarking.
