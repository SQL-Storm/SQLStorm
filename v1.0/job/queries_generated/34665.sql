### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: 
   - `MovieHierarchy`: A recursive CTE that starts with movies from the year 2000 or later, and recursively finds linked movies to establish a hierarchy.
   - `MovieCast`: A simple CTE that aggregates actors per movie, utilizing the `COUNT()` window function to count the number of actors per movie.

2. **SELECT statement**: This combines results from the hierarchical view of movies and the cast information to present:
   - The movie title and its production year.
   - The total number of actors (defaulting to 0 if none) participating in each movie.
   - Ranking each movie per production year based on the level of the hierarchy.

3. **Outer Join**: The `LEFT JOIN` on `MovieCast` ensures that movies without cast information are still included in the results.

4. **Complex predicates**: The query filters results to only include movies less than a certain level, focusing on immediate and first descendants in the hierarchy.

5. **Window functions**: Used here to count actors per movie and to rank movies by year.

6. **NULL handling**: The use of `COALESCE` to handle possible `NULL` values when counting actors is critical to delivering a complete dataset.

This elaborate SQL statement serves to benchmark performance by utilizing various SQL constructs efficiently on a complex schema.
