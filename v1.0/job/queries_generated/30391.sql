This SQL query includes a recursive CTE to build a hierarchy of movies based on episodes, selects the top 5 movies by production year for depths of up to 3, and joins this data with various other tables to extract names, roles, additional movie info, and keywords. It utilizes window functions, outer joins, and COALESCE for NULL logic to handle missing data gracefully.
