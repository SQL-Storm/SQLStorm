This SQL query incorporates the following complexities:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**: A recursive CTE to construct a hierarchical relationship among movies.
2. **Outer Joins**: Using `LEFT JOIN` to include movies even if they do not have cast information or associated aliases (akas).
3. **Aggregations**: Use of `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `STRING_AGG` to collect diverse metrics about the movies.
4. **FILTER clause**: Applied to `STRING_AGG` for conditional aggregation based on NULL values.
5. **Correlated Subquery**: Identifying the budget info type.
6. **Complicated Predicates**: Conditional checks using `HAVING` and our own complex logic.
7. **Performance Benchmarking**: An `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` step to measure performance once the query execution context is established.

This elaborates on various SQL techniques while drawing on practical relationships inherent in the benchmark schema.
