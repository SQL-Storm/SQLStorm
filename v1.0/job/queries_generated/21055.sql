This SQL query creates two Common Table Expressions (CTEs), `MovieHierarchy` and `RankedMovies`, to build a recursive structure that enables querying hierarchical relationships between movies and their connected links while ranking the movies per production year. It counts relevant cast information grouped by the movie ID, categorizing the popularity based on cast count, and aggregates keywords related to the movies, while using coalesce to provide default values when necessary. It demonstrates complex logic, including outer joins, window functions, and handling of NULL values, fulfilling the requirement for an elaborate and interesting SQL benchmark query.
