### Explanation of the SQL query:

1. **CTE - Recursive Movie Hierarchy**: 
   - This part builds a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to represent a hierarchical structure of movies based on their links. Starting from feature films (assuming `kind_id = 1`), it finds related titles.

2. **Main Select Statement**:
   - Selects the `person_id` and `actor_name`, aggregates data about movies each actor has participated in, counts distinct movies, calculates the average number of winning awards (checking if the info contains the word 'Award'), and aggregates the titles into a single string.
   - Uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include even those movies for which there might not be award information.
   - Filters out records with NULL names or pre-2000 productions and excludes NULL info from award results.

3. **Grouping and Ranking**:
   - Groups results by `person_id` and actor name. It ensures that only actors who have worked in more than 3 distinct linked movies based on the `HAVING` clause will be presented in the final results.
   - Introduces a ranking for actors based on the number of movies they've participated in, using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

4. **Ordering**: 
   - Results are ordered primarily by the count of participating movies and secondarily by average award-winning status.

The complexity arises from the combination of recursive queries, multiple joins, aggregate functions, partitioning, and conditional predicatesâ€”all essential for performance benchmarking in an extensive database schema like the one defined.
