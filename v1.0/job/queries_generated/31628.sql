### Explanation

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE, `movie_hierarchy`, is used to find all linked movies starting from those produced in or after the year 2000. This allows for exploration of movie relationships.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: The CTE is then linked with several tables like `movie_companies`, `company_name`, `complete_cast`, `cast_info`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword` to gather movie details, production companies, cast members, and associated keywords.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: Various aggregate functions are used:
    - `COUNT` counts distinct cast members.
    - `AVG` calculates the average length of personal information (if available).
    - `ARRAY_AGG` collects distinct keywords related to each movie.

4. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER` function ranks movies within their production years based on their titles.

5. **Complex Predicates**: The `HAVING` clause ensures the results only include movies with more than 5 distinct cast members.

6. **Filtering**: The query filters only top-level movies (those without linked predecessors) and requires their production year to be after 2000.

This query is designed to benchmark complex SQL functionalities, allowing for the assessment of performance when handling multiple joins, groupings, aggregations, and recursion.
