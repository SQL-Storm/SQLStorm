This SQL query performs complex operations involving recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, aggregations, and string manipulations to derive insights into notable movies and their connections based on defined criteria. The query takes into account movies from the year 2000 onwards, counts associated keywords, and retrieves synopses. It categorizes movies based on the number of keywords and organizes the final output efficiently while considering unusual and potentially obscure aspects of SQL syntax and logic.
