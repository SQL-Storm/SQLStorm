This SQL query is elaborated and includes several complex constructs:
- It uses a Recursive CTE to build a hierarchy of movies based on their links.
- The main SELECT incorporates a variety of JOINs, including LEFT JOINs, to gather data from multiple tables.
- It counts distinct keywords associated with each movie and employs conditional aggregation to gather directors based on the info_type.
- It uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords and check for NULLs.
- There are complex predicates to filter based on production year and title content.
- The GROUP BY clause aggregates the results, and HAVING filters those movie records that have more than one distinct keyword. 
- It also applies ordering and limits the output to the top 100 results, providing a performance benchmarking framework.
