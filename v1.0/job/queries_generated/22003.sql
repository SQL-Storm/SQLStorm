This query involves:
1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to partition movie data and count distinct actors by movie.
2. Outer joins to include movies without associated companies.
3. NULL handling using `COALESCE` and conditional expressions.
4. String aggregation of company names with `STRING_AGG`.
5. Complex predicates in `HAVING` and `WHERE` clauses, ensuring diversity in results while keeping the query intricate.
