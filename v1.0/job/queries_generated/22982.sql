### Explanation:
- **CTEs**: The query uses Common Table Expressions for organizing subqueries. The `RecursiveCTE` collects names, their aliases, and movies they've appeared in, focusing on female names. A number of window functions and aggregations follows to further filter results.
- **NULL Logic and Condition Simplification**: The handling of `NULL` logic showcases how SQL can accommodate diverse semantic interpretations by allowing `NULL` checks directly in the conditions.
- **String Aggregation**: Using `STRING_AGG` to accumulate distinct genres adds a more detailed perspective on the data.
- **Window Functions**: Feature `ROW_NUMBER` and `AVG` window functions to enrich the data output and compare with overall averages.
- **HAVING Clause**: Multiple filters applied to ensure the data satisfies specific requirements (like at least 4 movies, more than one movie per genre).
