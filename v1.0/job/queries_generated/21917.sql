### Explanation:
In the query:

1. **CTEs (With Clause)**:
   - `Movie_Hierarchy`: Creates a recursive CTE to build a hierarchy of movies linked. It starts with movies produced after 2000 and recursively finds linked movies up to 5 levels deep.
   - `Actor_Info`: Aggregates actor names and their roles, counting how many movies each actor has appeared in.
   - `Movie_Keywords`: Aggregates keywords associated with each movie using `STRING_AGG`.

2. **LEFT JOINs**:
   - You join `Movie_Hierarchy` with `Actor_Info` and `Movie_Keywords` to retrieve the detailed data about each movie and their corresponding actors and keywords.

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters movies produced between 2005 and 2023, including a condition to selectively include actors based on their movie count.

4. **ORDER BY** clause:
   - Orders the resulting movies by production year descending and actor movie count, and utilizes NULL logic to ensure that movies without actors appear at the end of the list.

5. **Pagination**: 
   - Utilizes `OFFSET` and `FETCH` to paginate results, returning the first 50 rows of the ordered result.

This SQL query features complexity with recursive CTEs, aggregations, window functions, string aggregations, and NULL logic, showcasing capabilities suitable for performance benchmarking.
