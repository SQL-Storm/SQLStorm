Explanation:
- This query aggregates data related to string processing in a movie database.
- It retrieves actor (via `aka_name`) or character names (via `char_name`), movie titles (via `title`), and keywords (from `keyword`).
- A filter is applied to select movies produced between 2000 and 2020.
- It groups by various fields and counts distinct movies for the actor/character along with an aggregated list of keywords.
- The final result set is ordered by year and total movies, which may highlight prominent names within the specified timeframe.
