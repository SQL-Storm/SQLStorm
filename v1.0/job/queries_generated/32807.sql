This complex SQL query involves:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a hierarchy of movies linked together.
- An auxiliary CTE (`RankedMovies`) that ranks movies by title within their production year and counts the total top-level movies (those from 2000 onwards).
- Multiple left joins to bring in related data from the `movie_keyword`, `keyword`, `complete_cast`, and `cast_info` tables.
- Utilization of window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `COUNT`) to produce ordered results and aggregate counts.
- NULL handling and default values using `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` for situations where there might be missing keywords or cast notes.
- The final selection filters movies produced after 2010 and orders the results by production year and title rank.
