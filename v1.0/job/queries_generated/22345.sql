### Explanation of the Query:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) - `title_hierarchy`:**
   - This recursive CTE is constructed to generate a hierarchy of titles where episodes relate back to their parent title. It begins with root titles that do not have an `episode_of_id` and recursively collects episodes, while tracking the depth of the hierarchy and the path of titles.

2. **Main Query:**
   - It selects from the `title_hierarchy`, joining it with several tables to gather additional information including the cast (`cast_info`), keywords (`movie_keyword`, `keyword`), and role types (`role_type`).
   
3. **Aggregation:**
   - The query counts distinct actors for each title, collects unique keywords into a comma-separated string, and also calculates the maximum depth of the title hierarchy.

4. **Handling NULL Logic:**
   - The sum of rows where `role_id` is NULL (`null_role_count`) counts how many roles are unspecified, reflecting how incomplete data is handled.

5. **CASE Expression:**
   - Examines if the maximum production year exists. If not, it labels the row as 'No Production Year'.

6. **HAVING Clause:**
   - Filters to only include titles with more than three distinct actors.

7. **Sorting and Limiting:**
   - The final results are ordered by the latest production year (with NULLs last) and maximum depth, limited to 10 results to focus on the most relevant entries.

This query showcases a variety of SQL constructs and complex logic that can be used for performance benchmarking within the schema provided.
