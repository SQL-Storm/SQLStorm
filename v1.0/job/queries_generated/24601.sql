### Explanation:

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - The `movie_hierarchy` CTE recursively builds a hierarchy of movies, capturing titles, production years, and keywords, connecting sequels to their original films.
  - The `actor_movie` CTE collects a mapping of actors to their respective movies from the `cast_info`, joining on the `aka_name` table for actor names.
  - The `ranked_actors` CTE ranks actors per movie by counting their occurrences to identify the top actors.
  - The `distinct_movies` CTE selects unique movies with their release years while ensuring that only those with keywords are considered.

- **Null Handling**:
  - The main query uses `COALESCE` to handle possible NULL values for actor names and ranks, providing fallback strings.

- **Complicated Predicate/Expressions**:
  - The `CASE` statement determines which era a movie belongs to based on its production year.

- **Window Functions**:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank the actors based on their counts per movie.

- **JOINs and NULL Logic**:
  - Several outer joins are employed to ensure that we still return movies even if some of their properties (like actors) might not be found.

This SQL query is designed to benchmark complex SQL features and execution plans, illustrating the capability to deal with hierarchies, window functions, and a variety of expressions and joins.
