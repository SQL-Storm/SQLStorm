### Explanation:

- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: A recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) is used to gather movies and their linked counterparts to establish a hierarchy, facilitating analysis of movie connections.

- **Joins**: The main query retrieves data from multiple tables:
  - `aka_title` to get basic movie details.
  - `cast_info` to count unique cast members.
  - `movie_keyword` linked to gather associated keywords through the `keyword` table.

- **Complex Logic**:
  - The query applies predicates like evaluating movie types (`kind_id` with nullable logic).
  - It uses the HAVING clause to filter movies with a significant cast count or those with no linked movies.

- **Aggregation and Window Functions**: Along with standard COUNT and MAX, this structure allows for analyzing the relationship depth of linked movies.

- **NULL Handling**: The check for NULL values ensures the inclusion of movies without links, adding depth and handling corner cases.

- **Ordering and Limit**: The final result is sorted primarily by the number of distinct cast members and then by link depth, producing a concise top 10 list for benchmarking performance.
