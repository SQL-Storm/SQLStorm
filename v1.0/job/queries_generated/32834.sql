This SQL query demonstrates a complex relationship between multiple tables, including:

- **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `MovieHierarchy` to build a hierarchy of movies, especially useful for handling episodes and series.
- **Aggregations**: Use of `COUNT`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`, and `STRING_AGG`.
- **Outer joins**: Using LEFT JOINs to include additional data while allowing for NULLs.
- **NULL logic**: Counting how many notes are NULL.
- **Complicated predicates and expressions**: Conditional aggregation in the AVG function.
- **GROUP BY and HAVING**: Grouping results on movie ID and actor name while filtering for those that meet the keyword count requirement.
- **Ordering**: Results are ordered based on keyword count and actor name, providing prioritized insights.

This query would be useful for performance benchmarking due to its complexity and the involvement of various SQL features that could affect execution plans and performance metrics.
