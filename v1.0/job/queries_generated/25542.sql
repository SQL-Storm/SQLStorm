This SQL query benchmarks string processing by performing multiple joins and aggregations on the data, specifically focusing on movies from the year 2000 onwards that feature more than five actors. It collects the unique keywords associated with each movie and lists them along with the movie title and year, ordered by the number of actors and title.
