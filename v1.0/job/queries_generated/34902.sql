This SQL query achieves several goals:

1. **Recursive CTE** to generate a hierarchy of movies from the `aka_title`.
2. Use of **window functions** to calculate the number of actors and the average age of those involved in each movie.
3. Complex **join structures** connecting multiple tables, including outer joins and grouping.
4. **String aggregation** to concatenate keywords associated with the title.
5. A **CASE statement** that differentiates role types for actors based on their note in cast info.
6. **Filtering and conditions** applied on various columns, ensuring the data is pertinent to a given range of production years.
7. Finally, the result set is ordered by production year and the number of actors, providing insightful output for benchmarking movie-related information.
