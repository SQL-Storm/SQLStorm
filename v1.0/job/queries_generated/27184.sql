This SQL query is meant for benchmarking string processing by aggregating movie-related data, including titles, production years, keywords, cast members, and company information. It organizes this data into a structured format while filtering for movies produced since the year 2000. The use of CTEs allows for clearer and more maintainable code, while the final output presents a comprehensive view of the desired metrics.
