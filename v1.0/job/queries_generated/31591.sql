This intricate SQL query is composed of multiple components, including:
- A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) named `movie_hierarchy` to create a hierarchy of movies produced since the year 2000.
- A second CTE called `actor_statistics` that aggregates data about actors, calculating their movie count and average production year.
- A third CTE, `keyword_counts`, which counts distinct keywords associated with movies.
- The final SELECT statement integrates these CTEs, applying filtering conditions and window functions to rank the results effectively. The query includes outer joins, subqueries, filtering based on calculations, and NULL logic to create an elaborate data set suitable for performance benchmarking.
