Explanation of the Query:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named `MovieHierarchy` is used to create a recursive structure of movies that are linked to each other.
- The main query retrieves movie titles along with their production years and associated actors. It also counts the number of production companies and aggregates keywords associated with each movie.
- `LEFT JOIN`s are utilized to gather actor, production company, and keyword data while handling potential NULL values (for missing data).
- A `HAVING` clause filters the results, ensuring only movies with a significant cast and multiple production companies are included.
- The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is applied for potential ranking or analysis purposes.
- A `COALESCE` function is used to provide a fallback value for actor names if no matching record is found. 

This query is structured to efficiently benchmark the performance of complex operations involving multiple joins, groupings, and filtering in a SQL environment.
