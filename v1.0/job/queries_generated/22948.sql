This SQL query:
- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure complex data retrieval tasks, including ranking titles, counting keywords, extracting cast information with roles, and gathering company details.
- Alleviates performance issues with indexed joins and appropriate use of window functions.
- Implements `LEFT JOIN` to capture all relevant titles while maintaining associations with mood groups, even if some data might be missing (NULL logic).
- Extracts ranking status reflecting a case of obscurity through a CASE statement indicating if a title has been ranked.
- Involves complicated predicates in the `HAVING` clauses that filter based on counts or group aggregates.
- Ranks titles and gathers supplemental information, ensuring a comprehensive view of the data set for performance benchmarking.
