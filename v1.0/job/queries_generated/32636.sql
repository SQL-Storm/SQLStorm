This SQL query involves multiple constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It uses a recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) to build a hierarchy of movies linked to each other along with keywords associated with them.
2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function ranks movies per production year based on their level in the hierarchy.
3. **Outer Joins**: It employs LEFT JOINs to ensure that movies without keywords still appear in the results.
4. **Correlated Subqueries**: None explicitly, but the recursion within a CTE is a logical flow.
5. **Complicated Predicates**: The WHERE clause filters for movies produced after 2000 with rank logic.
6. **NULL Logic**: The use of `COALESCE` handles NULL keywords by returning a default value.

The overall aim is to benchmark the performance while retrieving a hierarchical structure of movies, focused on their ranks within a production year up to the top 5, directing towards further enriching the query's complexity.
