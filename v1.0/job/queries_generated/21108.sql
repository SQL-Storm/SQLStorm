### Explanation:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `ranked_titles`: Ranks titles by year and counts the number of titles produced in each year, excluding NULL production years.
   - `filtered_cast`: Aggregates roles in `cast_info` where the note is NULL or contains "lead‚Äù, grouping by `movie_id` and `person_id`.
   - `movie_details`: Summarizes movie keywords associated with each title with a LEFT JOIN on `movie_keyword`.

2. **Combining the Data**:
   - The `final_results` CTE combines the previous CTEs to glean insights on the top-ranked titles, roles in the cast, and keyword counts, calculating an `interaction_score` as a product of total roles and total keywords.

3. **Final Selection**:
   - The main query filters these results to return only those movies with a ranked position of 5 or less, with at least some roles or no NULL roles and keywords of at least 3, while also categorizing interaction based on the score.

4. **ORDER BY & LIMIT**:
   - The results are ordered by the production year (descending) and interaction score (descending), providing a quantitative insight into the most actively engaged titles, limited to the top 50 results.

This complex SQL query illustrates multiple advanced concepts like window functions, CTEs, outer joins, and advanced filtering logic, yielding insightful outcomes while adhering to the schema provided.
