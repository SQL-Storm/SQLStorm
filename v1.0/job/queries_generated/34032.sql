### Explanation:
1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This CTE constructs a hierarchy of movies based on their linked relationships, collecting links to sequels or related films while keeping track of the depth in the hierarchy.

2. **Aggregating Movie Data (`top_movies`)**: This CTE calculates the total number of distinct actors for each movie and ranks them based on actor count and depth.

3. **Actors Information (`actors_info`)**: This CTE retrieves detailed information for actors involved in the movies, storing their ranks based on `nr_order`.

4. **Main Query**: The outer query pulls everything together, filtering for the top 10 movies based on actor count. It also retrieves synopsis counts while determining if an actor is ranked based on their ordering.

5. **Additional Constructs**: It employs window functions for ranking, outer joins to include all necessary data regardless of whether all actors have a `nr_order`, and correlated subqueries to count related synopses. 

### Complexity:
- Use of multiple CTEs allows structuring the query clearly while still implementing complex logic through correlated subqueries, window functions, and outer joins, making the query well-suited for performance benchmarking.
