### Explanation of SQL Query Components:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The recursive CTE `movie_hierarchy` creates a hierarchy of movies, linking them through a potential multi-level connection in the movie links.
- **Joins**: Utilizes multiple LEFT JOINs to gather data across the tables while handling NULLs by providing defaults such as 'Unknown Company' and 'Unknown Actor'.
- **Window Functions**: Calculates average modern releases (after 2000) and counts roles grouped by title kind.
- **String Aggregation**: Collects a list of featured actors while filtering out 'Unknown Actor'.
- **Complicated Predicates**: Implements sophisticated conditional logic within the `AVG` calculation to only consider modern releases.
- **Recursive Logic**: Demonstrates an iteration through related movies, up to a specified depth, showcasing complex relationships.
- **Filtering Mechanics**: Uses `FILTER` in conjunction with `STRING_AGG` to remove undesired values from the aggregated results.
- **ORDER BY**: Ensures that results are structured chronologically, favoring more recent productions. 

This query is structured to measure performance based on complex relationships and conditions while engaging with a variety of SQL features.
