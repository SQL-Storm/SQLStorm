This SQL query is designed for performance benchmarking, incorporating multiple SQL constructs and techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), outer joins, correlated subqueries, window functions, and aggregates. It features varied conditions, filtering with COALESCE and NULL handling, and also demonstrates a use of `HAVING` with more complex logic. The recursive CTE helps gather sequels with depth, while final ordering and limiting help synthesize results for performance analysis.
