### Explanation:
1. **CTEs**: Utilizes multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first rank movies by the number of distinct cast members (`ranked_movies`), filter for those with awards (`award_movies`), and find the top movies per production year (`top_years`).
  
2. **Aggregate Functions**: Uses aggregates like `COUNT` to tally the number of cast members and `MAX` with `CASE` to check for awards.

3. **Window Functions**: The query employs window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER` and `COUNT` to perform intricate rankings and calculations.

4. **Outer Joins**: Implements `LEFT JOIN` to include movies even if they lack associated companies or cast information.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The filtering in the final SELECT includes multiple conditions to assess movie eligibility based on cast size or award status.

6. **Case Logic**: Uses a `CASE` statement to label movies as 'Top Movie' or 'Not Top Movie' based on their rank in the context of their production year.

7. **Sorting and Output**: The final output is carefully ordered by production year and total cast, making analysis of trends over time straightforward. 

8. **NULL Logic**: Implements `COALESCE` to ensure no NULL values affect the boolean logic for award checks.
