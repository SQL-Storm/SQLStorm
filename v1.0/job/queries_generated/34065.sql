This query showcases a number of advanced SQL features:
1. **Recursive CTE**: `movie_hierarchy` to navigate linked movies.
2. **JOINs**: Multiple joins across the schema to pull actor, movie, and production data.
3. **Aggregations**: Use of `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG` to summarize data.
4. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank movies by each actor's performance.
5. **COALESCE and NULL logic**: To handle potential NULL values while calculating averages.
6. **HAVING**: To filter results based on a condition after aggregations are made.
7. **Complicated predicates/calculations**: To gather additional movie metrics (e.g., budget).

This query would be useful for benchmarking performance with various aspects of SQL optimization (JOIN types, CTE performance, and aggregate operations).
