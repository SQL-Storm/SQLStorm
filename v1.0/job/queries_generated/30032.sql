### Explanation of Query Components:

1. **WITH RECURSIVE CTE (Common Table Expression)**: 
   - The `movie_hierarchy` CTE selects movies and their episodes recursively, allowing a hierarchical representation of episodes related to their parent series.

2. **JOINs**:
   - The main query joins several tables: `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `movie_hierarchy`, and `movie_keyword`.
   - It uses an INNER JOIN to ensure that we only get actors with cast info and movies that are part of the defined hierarchy.
   - Additionally, it employs a LEFT JOIN for keywords to ensure all movies are represented even if they do not have associated keywords.

3. **Aggregations**:
   - The query counts keywords associated with each movie and aggregates them into a string using `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Window Function**:
   - A sub-select is used to calculate a `ROW_NUMBER()` as a ranking for each actor's role within each movie.

5. **Complicated Predicate Logic**:
   - The WHERE clause filters out movies from before the year 2000 and ensures that actor names are not NULL.

6. **Ordering**:
   - The results are ordered by production year (descending), actor name, and movie title for clarity in output.

This query serves as a comprehensive example of complex SQL constructs while also providing performance benchmark data to analyze relationships among actors, their roles, and associated movies in a structured way.
