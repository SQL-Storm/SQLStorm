This query introduces a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to traverse a hierarchy of movies linked to each other. It starts from movies released in the year 2000 or later and follows links to other movies, constructing a path of titles with each depth level representing a linked movie. 

In the main SELECT, several interesting constructs are employed:

- **LEFT JOINs** to fetch related data from multiple tables, including cast information, keywords, and linked titles associated with the movies.
- **Aggregate functions** like `COUNT` and `string_agg`, which summarize keyword counts and concatenate linked titles into a string representation.
- **COALESCE** is used to handle any NULL values in `cast_info.nr_order`, substituting them with `-1`.
- A **HAVING clause** filters the results to include only those movies that have more than three distinct keywords.
- The final results are ordered by depth and title, giving insights into the hierarchy of movie connections based on the derived relationships. 

This query can serve as an excellent performance benchmark due to its complexity and diversity of SQL features utilized.
