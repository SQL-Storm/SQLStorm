### Explanation of Constructs:
1. **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)**:
    - The `MovieHierarchy` CTE allows for querying a hierarchy of movies linked together based on their IDs.

2. **JOINs**:
    - Multiple types of joins (`JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) are used to gather necessary data across various tables.

3. **Aggregations**:
    - Use of `COUNT`, `STRING_AGG`, and `AVG` for generating aggregated information about movies associated with each actor.

4. **CASE Statements**:
    - For conditional formatting of the production year and handling NULLs.

5. **Window Functions**:
    - `RANK()` to rank actors based on their movie count.

6. **HAVING Clause**:
    - Specifies conditions on aggregated data.

7. **Predicates and Logic**:
    - Includes multiple conditions combining NULL checks, string checks, and numeric conditions.

8. **String Aggregation**:
    - Combining keywords and movie titles into single fields for easier readability. 

This query produces a sophisticated report on actors tied to a set of movies released in a specified timeframe, while also considering linked movies through a recursive relationship.
