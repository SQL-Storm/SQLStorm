### Explanation of Complexity in the Query:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The recursive CTE `ActorHierarchy` finds actors and their connections through films theyâ€™ve appeared in, limiting the levels to 5 to avoid infinite recursion.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: Throughout the query, various tables are connected using `LEFT JOIN`s ensuring that even if some relationships might not exist, the primary data (actors and their respective movies) is still returned.

3. **Aggregation Functions**: SUM, COUNT, MAX, and STRING_AGG are used to derive meaningful insights from the data including counts of movies, filtering based on years, and aggregating MD5 checksums.

4. **NULL Logic and CASE Statements**: Conditions handle cases where data may be NULL (i.e., checking if `t.production_year IS NULL`).

5. **String Aggregation**: The `STRING_AGG` function combines distinct MD5 checksums for actors when available, demonstrating the peculiar requirement for string manipulation.

6. **Array Aggregation**: `array_agg` is used to collect associated keywords for movies.

7. **HAVING Clause for Filtering**: The HAVING clause restricts results to actors who have played in more than five movies, showing an additional layer of filtering post-aggregation.

This query showcases multiple SQL constructs that can be challenging and beautiful, perfect for performance benchmarking across a wide schema.
