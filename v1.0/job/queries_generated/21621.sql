This SQL query utilizes multiple advanced features:
1. Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to generate unique names and roles for persons.
2. A mix of INNER, LEFT JOINs, and WHERE filtering to connect various tables and apply specific predicates.
3. Window functions for ranking roles and counting instances.
4. Complicated filtering logic for production companies and film releases to focus on a specific time frame.
5. An additional query at the end to find roles that have not been filled in any movies post-2010 while employing DISTINCT and another set of filtering conditions.
