This SQL query performs several complex operations:

1. **CTEs**: It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the query into manageable parts. `ranked_titles` ranks titles by their production year; `expanded_movies` gathers movie data joined with actor names; `movie_statistics` computes actor counts and names; `distinct_keywords` collects unique keywords for each movie; `combined_results` combines all this information into a final output set.

2. **Window Functions**: The query employs window functions like `ROW_NUMBER` and `DENSE_RANK` for handling ordered ranks of movies within their production years and overall.

3. **STRING_AGG**: The query makes use of `STRING_AGG` to concatenate actor names and keywords into single strings for easier readability.

4. **LEFT JOIN**: It uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure all titles are included, even if they lack associated keywords.

5. **Coalescing NULL values**: `COALESCE` is used to ensure that NULL values in the final output are replaced with default strings like 'No actors listed' or 'No keywords available'.

6. **Complicated predicates**: The WHERE clause includes a range condition for production years, filtering from 2000 to 2023.

This query exemplifies performance benchmarking by capturing a detailed overview of movies, their actors, and keywords while applying high-level SQL constructs, ensuring rich data handling and complex logic.
