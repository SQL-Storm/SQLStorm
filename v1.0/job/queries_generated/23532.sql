### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: This query uses two CTEs. The first `json_agg_movies` aggregates data for movies, their actors, and keywords, while ensuring that only movies with more than one company are included. The second CTE, `aggregated_movies`, further aggregates the results to consolidate different aspects of the movies.

2. **Complex Joins**: The query includes multiple left joins, facilitating a rich dataset by merging various tables. 

3. **Subqueries**: The main query uses an `EXISTS` clause to filter results based on a condition involving another table.

4. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank movies by production year and actor order.

5. **String Expressions**: The incorporation of `STRING_AGG()` allows for concatenation of actor names.

6. **NULL Logic**: The query utilizes `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` to handle missing data gracefully.

7. **Predicates**: The `HAVING` clause filters out results that donâ€™t meet the conditions regarding companies.

8. **Bizarre Semantics**: The expression that generates a `film_code` from `title` demonstrates the use of regex-like patterns and a fallback for missing values.

This query aims for performance benchmarking, ensuring that various SQL constructs are tested under load while we analyze movies with complex relationships and attributes.
