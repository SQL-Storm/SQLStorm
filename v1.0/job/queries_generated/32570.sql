This SQL query performs the following tasks:

1. It creates a recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`) to build a hierarchy of movies and episodes from the `aka_title` table.

2. Another CTE (`cast_role_summary`) summarizes the number of actors that played various roles for each movie using a combination of `COUNT` and `GROUP BY`.

3. A third CTE (`info_summary`) aggregates information related to movies, combining it into a single field and also counting the number of entries.

4. The main query joins these CTEs with the main `aka_title` table to get the desired details, with outer joins to ensure that movies without cast or information are still included.

5. Complicated predicates in the `WHERE` clause filter movies produced after the year 2000 and those that belong to specific `kind_id` values.

6. Finally, it orders the results by the production year and the total number of actors, limiting the output to the top 100 results for performance benchmarking.
