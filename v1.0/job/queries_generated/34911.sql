### Explanation
- **Recursive CTE (movie_hierarchy)**: It builds a hierarchy of movies, linking them based on the `movie_link` table, so that we gather all related movies for each original movie.
- **LEFT JOINs**: Used to include movies even if they donâ€™t have linked movies or cast information, ensuring no data is lost.
- **COALESCE**: Handles potential NULLs in the `nr_order` field, defaulting to 0 for the main movie.
- **Aggregations**: 
  - `MAX(h.nr_order)`: Finds the maximum order of cast roles for the related movies.
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT ml.linked_movie_id)`: Counts how many unique related movies exist.
  - `STRING_AGG`: Gathers the titles of related movies into a single string.
- **Filtering and Grouping**: It filters for movies produced after 2000, groups by original movie attributes, and ensures that only movies with valid cast orders are selected.
- **Ordering**: Results are ordered by production year and maximum cast order to focus on the most relevant movies from recent years.
- **Limit Clause**: Restricts the output to 10 rows, making it manageable for analysis purposes.
