This SQL query does several things:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `movie_hierarchy` CTE recursively fetches movies produced since 2000 and their linked movies up to a depth of 5.

2. **Aggregated Counts**: The `cast_role_counts` CTE counts distinct cast members per movie and aggregates their roles into an array.

3. **Keyword Aggregation**: The `keyword_aggregates` CTE uses `STRING_AGG` to gather all associated keywords for each movie.

4. **Final Selection**: The main query selects movie details alongside their types, filtering for movies with more than two cast members. Results are ordered by production year and the number of cast members before limiting the output to 10 entries.

This intricate query effectively demonstrates various SQL features, including outer joins, set operations, subqueries, and window functions while ensuring performance benchmarking and analytical capability.
