This query attempts to benchmark movies based on their average ratings, limiting results to the top 10, while dealing with NULL values and incorporating various SQL constructs such as CTEs, window functions, and outer joins. It also involves complex conditions that include handling obscured corner cases (like NULL ratings) and checking for certain conditions based on interconnected tables.
