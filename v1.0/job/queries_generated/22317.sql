This SQL query incorporates several advanced constructs:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses multiple CTEs, including recursive ones to build an actor hierarchy.
2. **Aggregations**: It aggregates movie titles for each actor and collects movie keywords.
3. **Row Number Window Function**: It ranks movies based on production year within their kind.
4. **Outer Joins**: Keywords are fetched using a left join, allowing for actors without keywords to still appear.
5. **Complex Case Logic**: Thereâ€™s a CASE statement to categorize actors based on the number of movies they have.
6. **Subqueries**: A subquery fetches the maximum production year to provide additional data in the final result.
7. **NULL Logic**: The usage of COALESCE ensures no NULL values are presented.
8. **String Aggregation**: The `STRING_AGG` function is used to gather movie titles into a single text field, ordered by production year.
9. **HAVING clause**: This applies filtering after aggregation to only show actors with more than two films. 

Overall, the query is designed for performance benchmarking within an intricate database structure dealing with movies and actors.
