This SQL query performs the following operations:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) `RankedMovies`:** 
   - Selects movies from `aka_title` and joins with `title` and `cast_info` to get the associated cast.
   - Counts distinct `person_id` to get the total cast for each movie.
   - Computes the average production year of all movies.
   - Aggregates all unique aka names for each movie into a single string.

2. **CTE `TopMovies`:** 
   - Ranks movies based on total cast count.

3. **Final Select:** 
   - Filters recent movies made in the last 5 years and selects the top 10 movies based on cast count.
   - Adds a category for the movies (Blockbuster, Moderate, Indie) based on the number of cast members.
   
The query effectively showcases string processing, aggregation, and ranking within the context of movie data.
