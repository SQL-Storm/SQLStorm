This SQL query performs the following operations to elaborate on performance benchmarking:

1. **CTE**: It creates a recursive common table expression (`movie_hierarchy`) to build a hierarchy of movies and linked movies since the year 2000, categorizing them into standard "Movies" and "Episodes."
  
2. **Joins**: It employs multiple joins, including inner joins between `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and the CTE to gather information about actors and the movies they've participated in.

3. **Aggregations**: The query returns various aggregate data such as the total count of movies per actor, average year of movie releases, and concatenated strings of titles.

4. **Filters**: It applies specific filters to ensure that actor names are valid and not blank and that it ignores uncredited roles.

5. **Having Clause**: It enforces a condition to return only those actors who have appeared in more than five movies.

6. **String Aggregation**: Used `STRING_AGG` with filtering to compile movie titles based on their types.

7. **Ordering**: The result set is ordered by the total number of movies in descending order, highlighting prolific actors.

This query reflects a comprehensive use of SQL concepts that are relevant for benchmarking SQL performance through complexity.
