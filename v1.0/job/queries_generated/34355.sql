### Explanation:
- **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A recursive CTE `ActorHierarchy` is defined to explore relationships among actors who worked together in movies released in 2020.
- **Joins**: The query combines `cast_info`, `title`, `aka_name`, `movie_keyword`, and `keyword` tables using several joins to retrieve relevant information.
- **COALESCE**: The `COALESCE` function is used to handle NULL values in the keywords for movies.
- **Window Function**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is calculated to give a ranking to coactors based on their level of connection.
- **Subqueries**: A correlated subquery fetches the kind ID for 'feature' movies.
- **HAVING and GROUP BY**: The final selection is grouped by the actor name and movie title, with a filter through `HAVING` to ensure we are querying only for movies with at least one co-actor.
- **Ordering**: Results are sorted by production year and the count of coactors. 

This query is intended for performance benchmarking by utilizing complex SQL features and various kinds of joins.
