This SQL query performs the following elaborate tasks:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Ranks movies by `production_year`.
   - `ActorMovieCounts`: Counts the number of movies per actor.
   - `MoviesWithKeywords`: Aggregates keywords for movies released after 2000.
   - `NullFiltering`: Uses `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` to handle potential `NULL` keyword values.
   - `OuterJoinDetails`: Combines details from the previous CTEs, handling NULL logic for keywords.

2. **Outer Joins**: CTEs include LEFT JOINs to ensure all relevant data is captured, whether or not a match is found.

3. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used for ranking movies.

4. **Set Operators** and Complex Predicates: The final selection uses predicates that utilize logical conditions to filter results that refine the dataset through additional constraints.

5. **Bizarre SQL Semantics**: There's a use of `ARRAY_AGG` to handle multiple keywords, and special handling of potential NULL values for keywords through the use of COALESCE with `NULLIF`.

6. **Sorting**: The final results are ordered by `production_year` and `movie_count`.

This structure combines multiple advanced SQL concepts into one complex query aimed at benchmarking performance in heavy relational datasets.
