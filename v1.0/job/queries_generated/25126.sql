This SQL query showcases complex operations involving multiple joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), ranking, and filtering to benchmark string processing across several related tables. It selects the top 10 titles post-2000 based on their keyword count, joining information from actors, companies, and additional person info, while ensuring meaningful and non-null data is returned.
