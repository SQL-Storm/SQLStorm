### Explanation:
- **CTEs**: Three Common Table Expressions are defined:
  - `ranked_movies`: To rank each movie based on the number of cast members per production year.
  - `top_movies`: To filter the top 3 ranked movies for each production year.
  - `movies_with_keywords`: To aggregate keywords for each movie.
  
- **Main Select**: The final selection gathers movie titles, their production years, associated keywords, a count of non-null casts, and the average rank of movies in the same year.

- **COALESCE**: Used to provide a fallback when there are no keywords, showing 'No keywords'.

- **Subqueries**: Two correlated subqueries calculate the count of distinct non-null cast entries and the average rank for the production year.

- **Outer Join**: A left join is utilized to ensure we keep all top movies even if they donâ€™t have associated keywords.

- **Bizarre SQL Semantics**: The use of `STRING_AGG` ensures retrieval of a list of keywords but if there exist no keywords, it defaults to specifying 'No keywords' thanks to the `COALESCE`.

This query is designed to evaluate the performance of complex joins, aggregations, and subqueries while accessing various dimensions of the movie data, showcasing SQL's capabilities in handling intricate logic and relationships.
