This query is structured to compose a comprehensive view of movie details in a way that benchmarks string processing. The `WITH` clauses create a common table expression (CTE) that gathers essential information about movies, including their titles, production years, cast counts, alternate names, associated keywords, and companies involved in each movie. Final metrics are generated in the second CTE `Benchmark`, including string lengths, and calculated averages based on cast size. The final output is ordered by the most recent productions with the largest casts.
