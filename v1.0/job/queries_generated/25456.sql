### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Created a CTE named `ranked_movies` that retrieves the top 10 movies released between 2000 and 2023 based on the total cast size. It joins various tables (`title`, `complete_cast`, `cast_info`, `aka_name`) to get movie details and a string aggregation of cast names.

2. **Main Query**: The main query selects movie details from the `ranked_movies` and adds linked movies and their relationship type by joining the `movie_link` and `link_type` tables.

3. **Ordering**: Results are ordered by year of production in descending order and then by total cast size. This query can be used to assess the richness of movie casts and their interlinking relationships in terms of movie links, demonstrating string processing through name aggregations and detailed joins.
