### Explanation of the Query:
1. **CTE RecursiveMovieCTE**: This generates a list of movies made after 2000 along with the actors' names. It assigns a row number to each actor per movie to allow future ordering and grouping.

2. **CTE ProminentActors**: This identifies actors with more than five roles across any movies within the previous CTE.

3. **CTE MoviesWithActorCount**: This aggregates the count of actors in each movie.

4. **Main Query**: Combines results from the previous CTEs, counting actors per movie and linking performances of prominent actors to each movie through left outer joins and correlated subqueries. 

5. **Filtering and Sorting**: The final output includes only those movies with more than two actors and provides counts of both actors and significant appearances of prominent actors while sorting by movie title and actor count.

This elaborate SQL incorporates various SQL constructs, including CTEs, outer joins, aggregation, and correlated subqueries, suitable for performance benchmarking.
