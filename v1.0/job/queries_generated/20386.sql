### Query Explanation:
1. **CTE - MovieHierarchy**: Creates a recursive structure to establish the hierarchy of movies connected by links, forming a path of titles from the root movie.

2. **Main SELECT**: 
    - Extracts details from the `MovieHierarchy` CTE including movie ID, title, year, depth in hierarchy, and the path constructed leading to that movie.
    - Counts distinct actors in the cast for each movie and averages salaries from the `person_info`, filtered to only consider salary information.
    - Uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords associated with each movie, demonstrating aggregation with string manipulation.
    - Performs a left join to include company information, using `COALESCE` to handle any NULL results, defaulting to 'No Company'.
    - Counts the complete cast entries tied to the movies for additional metrics.

3. **GROUP BY**: Aggregate results based on movie IDs and rest of the selected columns.

4. **HAVING Clause**: Filters results to include only those movies that have more than 5 distinct actors and more than 2 distinct keywords, which helps identify more prominent films.

5. **ORDER BY**: Orders the movies by depth in hierarchy and average salary descending, treating NULL salaries as last.

6. **FETCH FIRST 50 ROWS ONLY**: Limits the result set to the top 50 entries, useful for performance benchmarking.

This concoction of SQL elements is designed not only to demonstrate complex constructions but also illustrates practical use cases like aggregating and filtering data effectively.
