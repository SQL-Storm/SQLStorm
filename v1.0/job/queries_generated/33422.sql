This SQL query includes several advanced constructs:

1. A recursive common table expression (CTE) to retrieve movies including episodes.
2. Use of window functions to rank cast members.
3. Outer joins to gather comprehensive movie and company information.
4. Use of string aggregation functions to collect multiple company names and types.
5. CASE statement for categorizing movies based on their production year.
6. COALESCE and NULLIF to handle null and empty string values gracefully.
