This SQL query accomplishes several objectives:

1. **Recursive CTE**: It creates a recursive CTE to get a hierarchy of movies that are linked to each other, filtering for movies produced after 2000.

2. **Aggregated Data**: It aggregates actor information, counting distinct actors, providing information about co-stars, and collecting keywords associated with each movie.

3. **Window Functions**: It uses a `ROW_NUMBER` window function to rank movies by the number of distinct actors participating in them.

4. **Outer Joins and Grouping**: The usage of LEFT JOIN allows the query to include movies even if they don't have keywords associated with them. Grouping is utilized to summarize data at the actor and movie levels.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: It includes checks for NULL values and string expressions to ensure only valid actors are included in the results.

This query can provide insights into actors' collaborative networks and movie relationships, lending itself well to performance benchmarking.
