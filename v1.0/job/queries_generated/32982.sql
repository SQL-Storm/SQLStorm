This SQL query uses multiple advanced constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and outer joins. It benchmarks the performance of querying movie titles with their related cast information, statistics about keywords associated with the movies, and recursively linked movies while showcasing NULL logic and complex predicates.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. **CTEs**:
   - `Movie_Cast`: Retrieves the names of actors associated with each movie, along with their order in the cast.
   - `Movie_Info_Stats`: Aggregates keyword information for each movie.
   - `Recursive_Movies`: Recursively finds linked movies.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: This structure allows for the inclusion of movies even if they lack corresponding cast or keyword entries, thus effectively handling cases where data might be missing (NULL).

3. **Window Function**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function partitions the list of actors per movie and orders them, which is useful for obtaining ranking without creating separate queries.

4. **CASE Statement**: Determines if keywords exist and provides a contextual output.

5. **Complex Predicates**: Includes conditions to filter movies based on a production year threshold and checks for NULLs in the surname field or keyword count.

6. **Ordering**: The final results are ordered by production year and actor order for clearer presentation of the data.

This query is an example of how one can incorporate various SQL concepts to generate a rich, informative output while benchmarking SQL performance.
