In this SQL query:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Three CTEs are utilized. 
   - `actor_hierarchy`: Retrieves an ordered sequence of roles per actor who acted in a movie since 2000.
   - `use_of_actors`: Counts total movies per actor and finds the maximum sequence of roles.
   - `qualified_actors`: Filters actors with more than 5 movies and non-null sequences.

2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function ranks actors based on their total movie appearances and role sequences.

3. **Left Joins and Subqueries**: The main query leverages subqueries to filter companies based on the specific country (USA) and joins movie information accordingly.

4. **Complex Predicate/Expressions**: Includes filters on movie info where it isn't NULL and does not contain "N/A".

5. **Potential Edge Cases**: Handling NULL values and ensuring rankings filter accurately.

This query provides performance benchmarks on actors based on defined criteria while showcasing advanced SQL semantics and structure.
