### Query Breakdown:
1. **CTEs**:
   - **`RankedMovies`**: Gets the movies and assigns a rank based on production year and title.
   - **`ActorCounts`**: Counts distinct actors for each movie.
   - **`TopMovies`**: Combines `RankedMovies` with `ActorCounts`, ordering by actor count.
   
2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins `TopMovies` with company information, keywords, and movie details using multiple outer joins. 
   - Uses `STRING_AGG` to collect keywords.
   - Applies `FILTER` with `MAX` to grab summaries without NULL values.
   - Counts related movies filtered by several criteria.

3. **Conditions And Logic**:
   - Filters results to the top 10 performers per year with films having more than 5 actors and more than 1 keyword.
   - Uses `COALESCE` for company names, managing NULLs. 

4. **ORDERING & GROUPING**:
   - Results are ordered by production year descending and actor count for insight into newer popular movies. 

This SQL query uses a complex structure and multiple techniques to benchmark and analyze movie data effectively.
