This SQL query achieves the following:

1. **Recursive CTE**: Establishes a hierarchy of movies and their linked movies starting from the ones produced after 2000.
  
2. **Outer Joins**: Joins several tables to gather additional data about movies, cast information, and companies, while gracefully handling potential nulls.

3. **Aggregations**: Calculates actor counts, collects actor names into a single string, and computes an info presence ratio.

4. **Complex Conditions**: Applies conditions to filter movies produced between 2000 and 2010 and ensures the country code of the companies is not null.

5. **Window Functions**: Implicitly computes aggregates through `GROUP BY`, while capitalizing on distinct counts and string aggregations.

6. **String Expressions**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to combine actor names into one field.

This query is well-suited for performance benchmarking, as it pushes multiple relational features and query constructs to challenge the SQL engine's optimization capabilities.
