This SQL query achieves several interesting goals and incorporates various constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It uses multiple CTEs, starting with `RankedMovies`, which calculates an actor count and a ratio of movies with notes, followed by `FilteredMovies` which selects movies with specific constraints.

2. **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to rank movies by the number of actors.

3. **Set Operators**: Although not explicitly used in this example, the CTE structure allows for seamless integration of additional set-based operations if needed.

4. **Outer Joins**: `LEFT JOIN`s are utilized to include movies that may not have matching records in related tables.

5. **Complicated Predicates and Calculations**: It includes conditional counts and calculations (e.g., `AVG(CASE WHEN ci.note IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`).

6. **String Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords associated with each movie.

7. **NULL Logic**: Utilizes `COALESCE` to handle potential NULL values for keywords and includes logic for unknown company counts.

8. **Bizarre Semantics**: The case statements used in the final selection add an unusual and specific formatting logic to present the data.

This query could serve as a benchmark for performance testing in a complex SQL environment.
