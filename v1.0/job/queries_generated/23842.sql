This SQL query does the following:

1. Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to build recursive movie details including actors, companies, and keywords.
2. Filters the movie details to only include movies with keywords (more than one) or where the `total_keywords` is NULL.
3. Ranks the filtered movies based on their production year and the sequence of actors.
4. Applies complex predicates that check for null values and specific conditions on the `production_year` and actor names.
5. Applies pagination to fetch a subset of the results while maintaining a specific order.
6. This setup can be used rigorously for performance benchmarking on multiple join types along with window functions.

This query exemplifies advanced SQL features, potentially revealing performance characteristics when dealing with larger datasets.
