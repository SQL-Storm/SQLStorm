### Explanation of the Query:

1. **CTEs**:
   - `movie_actors`: Collects actors and their corresponding ranking per movie using `ROW_NUMBER()` for ordering their names.
   - `movie_year_keywords`: Gathers movie production years along with their associated keywords to facilitate further calculations.
   - `ranked_movies`: Ranks movies based on the count of associated keywords using `DENSE_RANK()`.

2. **Final Query**:
   - Joins the ranked movies, actors, and keywords to encompass various details about each movie.
   - Incorporates a `CASE` statement to analyze the state of keywords available for each movie.
   - Outputs the maximum keyword found per movie and counts the distinct actors associated with it.

3. **HAVING Clause**:
   - Ensures only movies with more than 2 distinct actors are included or those that have keyword data.

4. **ORDER BY**:
   - Sorts results by rank and keyword count in descending order, followed by actor rank to provide clear insights into the performance of each movie in the dataset.

This query demonstrates various SQL constructs and elegantly handles NULL values, ranking, and grouping to provide a rich performance benchmark report.
