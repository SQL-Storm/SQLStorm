This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. It creates a recursive common table expression (CTE) named `cast_hierarchy` to establish a relationship hierarchy for cast members, allowing to retrieve related entries in the `cast_info` table based on role.
  
2. The main query retrieves information from multiple tables, including `title`, `aka_title`, `aka_name`, `movie_keyword`, `keyword`, and `complete_cast`, using various types of joins such as INNER, LEFT OUTER, and a lateral join.

3. It uses aggregate functions such as `STRING_AGG` to concatenate keywords for each movie, `COUNT` to count distinct cast members, and `AVG` to calculate the average length of actor names.

4. Additionally, the query incorporates a subquery within the lateral join to retrieve the salary information of the actors.

5. The `HAVING` clause is used to filter results for movies that have more than five cast members.

6. Finally, the results are ordered by production year and maximum actor salary in descending order. 

This query aims to highlight complex relationships, use various SQL features effectively, and provide meaningful insights for benchmarking performance.
