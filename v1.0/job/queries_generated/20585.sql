### Explanation of the query:

1. **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: 
   - The `movie_hierarchy` CTE constructs a recursive hierarchy of movies and their episodes. It starts with any movie designated as an episode of another and recursively fetches the parent movies.
   - `cast_summary` aggregates the total cast count and checks for unnamed roles (when `note` is NULL or empty).
   - `keyword_summary` collects all keywords associated with each movie into a single string per movie.

2. **Main SELECT Statement**:
   - Selects various fields including the title of the movie, associated keywords, hierarchy level, and cast information.
   - Uses `COALESCE` to handle null values in keywords gracefully by providing a fallback text ('No Keywords').
   - Utilizes a `CASE` statement to deliver a status on whether there is cast information based on the total cast count.

3. **JOIN Operations**:
   - Joins are performed with left joins to ensure that movies with no episodes or cast members still appear in the results.

4. **WHERE Clause and Filtering**:
   - Filters movies that fall into a specified production year range or have 'Remake' in their titles.
   - Checks for movies that have hierarchical data or cast information.

5. **Ordering of Results**:
   - The results are ordered by production year (descending), hierarchy level, and movie title, providing a structured output.

This SQL query incorporates multiple constructs, such as recursive CTEs, aggregation, case expressions, outer joins, and more, making it a complex and comprehensive example for performance benchmarking.
