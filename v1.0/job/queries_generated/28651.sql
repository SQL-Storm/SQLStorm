This query effectively performs a benchmark on string processing involving multiple tables with a focus on titles, cast members, and their associated companies. It ranks movies by the number of cast members, retrieves titles of those movies produced in the same year, and counts the distinct company types associated with those movies, providing interesting insights into the actorsâ€™ filmographies in terms of production characteristics.
