### Explanation:
1. **CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: A recursive Common Table Expression that starts from the `aka_title` table to find a hierarchy of movies and their linked counterparts.
  
2. **Join Operations**: Combines data from multiple tables:
   - `cast_info`: to get the cast for each movie.
   - `person_info`: to derive gender information from actors.
   - `movie_companies` & `company_name`: to retrieve company names associated with each movie.

3. **Aggregations**: Uses aggregates to count total cast, male and female actors, and company names, demonstrating a mix of `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `STRING_AGG`.

4. **Window Function**: Applies `ROW_NUMBER` to rank movies by cast size within each production year.

5. **Filtering (HAVING)**: Ensures that only movies with more than 5 distinct cast members are included in the final output.

6. **Complex Predicate**: Handles null checks for `production_year` and applies logical conditions on years (`AND`, `OR`).

This query provides a comprehensive analysis of movies produced after 2000 that have a significant cast and displays their production years, total cast, and genders while leveraging various SQL features for performance benchmarking.
