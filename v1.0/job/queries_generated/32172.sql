### Explanation:
1. **CTE MovieHierarchy**: This recursive CTE gathers information on movies and their linked counterparts. It captures all movies identified by the `kind = 'movie'` and recursively links to any associated titles (like sequels or spinoffs) captured in the `movie_link` table.

2. **CTE CastCount**: This aggregates and counts the number of actors associated with each movie from the `cast_info` table.

3. **CTE FilteredMovies**: This combines the MovieHierarchy and CastCount to create a structure that includes the title, production year, the count of actors, and depth in the hierarchy.

4. **Final SELECT**: This retrieves titles where the actor count is greater than zero and the movie was produced from the year 2000 onwards. It ranks these movies by actor count within each production year.

5. **Window Function**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to order the resulting movies by the number of actors, partitioned by production year.

This query combines various SQL techniques such as CTEs, joins (including outer joins), window functions, and aggregates to create a complex and interesting benchmark query.
