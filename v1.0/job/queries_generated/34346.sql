This query does the following:

1. It begins with a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) called `movie_hierarchy` that constructs a hierarchy of linked movies starting from movies produced after the year 2000.
2. It collects the names of actors alongside the count of distinct movies they are associated with, using `COUNT(DISTINCT mk.movie_id)`.
3. The `string_agg` function is used to concatenate the titles of the movies into a single string for each actor.
4. It calculates the maximum link depth of the movies and the average production year.
5. Thereâ€™s conditional logic in the `WHERE` clause to filter out records where actor names are NULL or empty.
6. The result is grouped by actor's name, and only actors with more than 5 distinct movies are retained due to the `HAVING` clause.
7. Finally, it orders the results by the count of movies descending and actor names in ascending order.
