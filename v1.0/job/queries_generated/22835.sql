This elaborate SQL query includes the following constructs:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Three CTEs are used to calculate the top movies by cast size, the total number of production companies, and the aggregation of keywords associated with each movie.
   
2. **JOINs**: Joins are employed to connect the different pieces of information across the related tables.

3. **Aggregations**: The use of `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` and `STRING_AGG(...)` helps in calculating the required aggregates and lists.

4. **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to rank movies by total cast in their respective production years.

5. **NULL Handling**: Uses `COALESCE()` to handle NULLs when no companies or keywords are found for a movie.

6. **CASE Statement**: It categorizes the size of the cast into 'Big Cast', 'Medium Cast', or 'Small Cast' based on the number of cast members.

7. **Correlated Subqueries**: In the `LEFT JOIN`, correlated subqueries retrieve the title based on the `movie_id`.

8. **Filtering and Ordering**: Filters the results to the top 10 movies of each production year and orders by year descending and cast size descending.

This complex SQL showcases advanced capabilities and highlights various semantic nuances, making it a strong candidate for performance benchmarking.
