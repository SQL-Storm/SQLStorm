This SQL query aims to benchmark complex performance through various constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: Constructs a hierarchy of movies based on links between them.
2. **Aggregations and Window Functions**: Calculates the count of distinct production companies per movie and averages completion rates based on available information.
3. **Outer Joins**: Includes left joins to ensure information on productions and movie info is included where available.
4. **NULL Handling**: Uses the `COALESCE` function to prevent NULLs in the reported metrics.
5. **Complicated Predicates/Expressions**: The query filters actors whose names contain 'John' and require that they have multiple role entries.
6. **String Expressions**: Uses `ILIKE` to make the name search case-insensitive.

This combination of elements makes the query complex and suitable for performance benchmarking in a sophisticated SQL environment.
