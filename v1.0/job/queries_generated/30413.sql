This query performs an elaborate analysis of films produced after 2000, retrieving their related cast and information on keywords, while demonstrating various advanced SQL techniques. The use of recursive CTEs allows for hierarchical querying of linked movies, while correlated subqueries and window functions provide insights into the cast and movie information summation.
