-- Additional parts to implement if required:
-- Assume that the 'movie_ratings' table has already been created,
-- which holds a mapping of 'movie_id' to 'rating' values for the benchmarking purpose.

This SQL query performs a multi-step operation to benchmark movie titles based on their ratings and the count of their cast members. It uses recursive common table expressions (CTEs) to build a movie hierarchy for episodic content, followed by aggregating ratings and cast information, ultimately filtering the top-rated movies per production year. Additionally, the use of `COALESCE` handles NULL values appropriately, giving an indication when no ratings exist. The query is structured for flexibility and extensibility in a benchmarking context.
