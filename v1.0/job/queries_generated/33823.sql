This query performs the following functions:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: It defines a recursive CTE `MovieHierarchy` to build a hierarchy of movies where episodes relate back to their parent titles.

2. **JOINs**: It involves multiple joins including:
   - Joining actor names with their casting information.
   - Linking cast information with the movie hierarchy and keywords.

3. **Aggregation**: It counts the distinct movies each actor has appeared in, calculates the average hierarchy level of the movies they starred in, and aggregates keywords associated with the movies.

4. **NULL Logic**: Incorporates `COALESCE` to ensure a graceful fallback in case there is no movie information.

5. **Filtering**: Uses predicates to filter for movies produced after 2000 and ensures that actor names and role info are not NULL.

6. **String Aggregation**: Uses `STRING_AGG` to collect all distinct keywords into a single string per actor.

7. **Grouping and Ordering**: It groups the results by actor and their title kind, ordering the final output by the number of movies acted in and average hierarchy level. 

This complex query can be useful for performance benchmarking as it tests various SQL functionalities and optimizations effectively.
