### Explanation:

1. **Recursive CTE (MovieHierarchy)**: This is used to create a hierarchy of movies, allowing us to explore relationships between movies and their sequels or collections.

2. **SELECT Clause**: We select key fields:
   - Actor's name.
   - Movie title.
   - The count of distinct actors per movie using a window function `COUNT(DISTINCT ci.person_id) OVER (PARTITION BY ti.id)`.
   - The average of keyword IDs for the movie, using `COALESCE` to handle any NULL values.
   - Count of character names associated with the actor's IMDB index.
   - A row number to sort actors on a per-movie basis.
   - A CASE statement classifying each movie into 'Classic', 'Modern', and 'Recent' based on the production year.

3. **JOINs**: 
   - Joins on `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and `title` to gather actors and their movies.
   - Left joins on `char_name` and `movie_keyword` to gather additional character and keyword information without excluding entries when null.

4. **WHERE Conditions**: 
   - Ensures actor names are not NULL.
   - Filters only feature films and restricts movie hierarchy depth.
  
5. **GROUP BY and HAVING**: 
   - Groups results by actor name and movie title, applying a filter to only include actors who have appeared in more than one movie.

6. **ORDER BY**: 
   - Orders primarily by the distinct actor count and then their position in the movie list.

This query elaborates on relationships between movies, their cast, and further engages with other related data, providing a comprehensive view useful for performance benchmarking.
