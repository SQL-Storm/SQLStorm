In this SQL query, we leverage the following advanced constructs:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE allows us to traverse the movie link structure to find linked movies and their hierarchy.
  
2. **Window Functions**: We apply RANK() and ROW_NUMBER() to rank actors based on movie counts and order movies for each actor, respectively.

3. **Subqueries**: We utilize subqueries to filter and aggregate data regarding actors and their related movies.

4. **NULL Logic**: We use `COALESCE()` to handle NULL values when there are no keywords associated with a movie.

5. **Outer Joins**: The LEFT JOIN structures allow retrieval of all data from one side while matching from the other side where possible.

6. **Complicated Filtering**: The WHERE clause consolidates several filters, providing specific conditions to refine outputs based on movie production years.

7. **Order of Execution**: The final SELECT statement's ordering provides a clear view of actors and their movie representation for analysis.

The performance of the query can also be assessed with the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` tool to evaluate how well it performs with the imposed conditions and joins.
