This query establishes complex `WITH` clause CTEs to pre-calculate rankings, actor contributions, and keywords. It selects data from joined tables for movies produced between 2000 and 2020, counts distinct actors in each movie, and sums keyword occurrences to evaluate popular movies. The final selection categorizes movies while filtering and ordering the results.
