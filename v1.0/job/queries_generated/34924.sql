This SQL query implements various constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`)**: Builds a hierarchy of movies, allowing for a multi-level structure where movies can be linked to others.
  
2. **Aggregations**: Counts the total cast and keywords, and aggregates company names and cast names using `STRING_AGG` and `ARRAY_AGG`.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Utilizes subqueries for counting keywords and getting names from `aka_name`.

4. **Outer Joins**: Uses `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that even movies without associated companies or cast are included in the results.

5. **COALESCE**: Manages potential NULL values by replacing them with zeros when counting keywords.

6. **Complicated Expressions**: The `CASE` statement within `ARRAY_AGG` demonstrates NULL logic and conditional aggregation.

7. **Ordering and Grouping**: Orders by production year and depth to provide a structured output. 

This query is complex and would be suitable for benchmarking performance in a database environment with significant data volumes.
