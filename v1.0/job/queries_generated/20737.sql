In this query:

1. A Common Table Expression (CTE) called `MovieHierarchy` is created to establish a recursive relationship between movies (e.g., linking sequels, prequels).
2. The main query aggregates data to find actors, their movies, keywords associated with those movies, and any additional person info.
3. The query uses `COALESCE` to manage NULL values and `STRING_AGG` to create a comma-separated list of keywords, defaulting to "No Keywords" if none exist.
4. A correlated subquery is employed to compute an average, incorporating NULL logic if no info is available.
5. The filter conditions apply non-null checks and exclusions, creating complex predicate expressions.
6. The results are grouped and ordered by year and number of linked movies to facilitate performance benchmarking in the query execution plan.
