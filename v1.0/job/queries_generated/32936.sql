This query performs the following actions:

1. **ActorHierarchy**: Constructs a recursive CTE to build a hierarchy of actors based on their roles in movies.
   
2. **MovieStats**: Aggregates movie titles produced since the year 2000, counting unique actors and concatenating their names.

3. **TopMovies**: Ranks these movies by the number of actors.

4. **FilteredMovies**: Filters to obtain the top 10 movies based on the actor count.

5. **CompanyInfo**: Collects production companies and their types for each movie.

6. **Final Selection**: Combines all gathered data together, excluding movies if the actor hierarchy depth is 1 (single actor) and providing default values for company information if none exist. 

This elaborate construct combines multiple SQL concepts including recursive CTEs, subqueries, window functions, and advanced join techniques to yield a comprehensive and insightful dataset for performance benchmarking.
