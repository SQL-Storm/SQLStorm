### Explanation of Constructs Used:

1. **Recursive CTE**: `MovieHierarchy` constructs a hierarchy of movies linked to one another, accommodating sequels or related films using a self-join on the `movie_link` table.

2. **Aggregations**: Using `GROUP_CONCAT` to aggregate keywords associated with each movie, and `COUNT` to get the total number of distinct cast members.

3. **Window Functions**: The `first_value` window function identifies the first order of the role for each actor.

4. **Null Logic and COALESCE**: Handles cases where a movie might not have any keywords, providing a default string.

5. **Complicated Predicates**: The `WHERE` clause checks for production years after 2000 and ensures names do not include "Unknown".

6. **Join Operations**: Combining multiple tables including `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `MovieHierarchy`, `aka_title`, and subsequently `movie_keyword` and `keyword`.

7. **HAVING Clause**: Filters results, ensuring only actors who were part of more than one movie are considered. 

This elaborate SQL query is suitable for performance benchmarking as it effectively demonstrates various SQL features and showcases potential execution challenges in a real-world scenario.
