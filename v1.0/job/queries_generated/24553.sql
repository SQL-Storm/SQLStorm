### Explanation:

1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Counts the number of distinct cast members for each movie and ranks them by production year. 
   - `TopMovies`: Selects the top 5 movies with the most cast members per production year.
   - `MovieKeywords`: Aggregates keywords for each movie.
   - `MovieInfo`: Joins the top movies with their keywords and filters to get only synopses from the `movie_info` table.

2. **Aggregations and String Functions**:
   - `STRING_AGG` is used to concatenate keywords.
   - `CHAR_LENGTH` and `REPLACE` are used to count words in the movie synopsis.

3. **COALESCE for NULL Handling**:
   - Provides defaults for NULL fields, and uses a CASE statement to handle experimental status.

4. **Subquery for Additional Data**: 
   - Includes a subquery to add additional experimental data for movies produced after 2000 that have more than 2 pieces of info.

5. **Outer Joins**: 
   - Used to include all movies in `MovieInfo` regardless of whether they have experimental data or keywords.

6. **Ordering**:
   - Sorts by production year descending and then by title ascending to organize results efficiently.

This query benchmarks database performance across complex joins and aggregations while covering various SQL features and considerations.
