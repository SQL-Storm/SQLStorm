This SQL query generates a detailed benchmarking result showcasing information about movies, including their titles, production years, cast counts, associated keywords (if they exceed a certain count), and companies (if multiple companies are involved). The `rank` function ensures only the latest production year per movie is considered, while the `HAVING` clauses enforce conditions on keyword counts and company counts.
