### Explanation:
1. **RankedMovies CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of distinct cast members (i.e., actors) for each movie, aggregates the names of the actors, and ranks the movies by the count of cast members within each production year.

2. **TopMovies CTE**: This CTE retrieves only the top 5 movies from the `RankedMovies` CTE based on the count of cast members.

3. **Final Select**: The final query joins the top movies with the `movie_companies` and `company_name` tables to count and list the number of production companies associated with each of the top movies. 

4. **Results**: The output includes the movie title, production year, number of cast members, actor names, and number of production companies along with their names, ordered by production year and cast count.

### Notes:
- `STRING_AGG` or `GROUP_CONCAT` function usage may depend on the specific SQL dialect being used; you may need to adjust if using a database not supporting these directly (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- This query can be enhanced further as required, adjusting filters or including other tables for more comprehensive metrics or different rankings.
