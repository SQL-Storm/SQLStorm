-- EXPLANATION OF SEMANTICAL ELEMENTS:
-- 1. Window functions are used to rank movies by production year and roles by order.
-- 2. A CTE gathers keywords, utilizing STRING_AGG for concatenation.
-- 3. Multiple predicates with NULL checks to cover edge cases of missing roles.
-- 4. Usage of COALESCE to handle NULL values in calculations.
-- 5. Outer joins ensure all movies are included even if they lack roles or keywords.
-- 6. The main query combines results with intricate filtering that highlights specific years and genres.
