This query is designed to benchmark performance with the following constructs:

1. **CTEs**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Counts the number of cast members per movie and ranks them within each production year.
   - `CompanyDetails`: Gathers company details related to each movie.
   - `NullCheck`: Counts the number of NULL `person_id` entries in the `cast_info`.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: To form the relationship with potential null matches from the cast and companies.

3. **Aggregates and Window Functions**: To perform intricate aggregations and create rankings and company lists.

4. **Subquery**: For finding the maximum production year dynamically.

5. **COALESCE**: To handle potential NULL cases in the null count.

6. **String Aggregation**: The `GROUP_CONCAT` function (or equivalent depending on SQL dialect) is used to compile company names.

7. **Complicated CASE Logic**: To categorize the movies based on their rank.

8. **Order and Limit**: Gives performance insights into how many top movies there are based on the number of cast members.

This SQL query aims to assess performance while also handling a variety of SQL components and logic.
