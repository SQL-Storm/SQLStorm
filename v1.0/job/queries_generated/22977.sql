### Explanation:
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
   - `RankedMovies`: Retrieves movies with their production year and ranks them within each year, while aggregating keywords into a single string.
   - `ActorCounts`: Counts distinct actors for each movie.
   - `MoviesWithActorCounts`: Joins the previous CTEs to combine movie data with actor counts, handling NULLs appropriately.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Selects various fields including actor counts, computes a label for actor presence, categorizes movies into eras based on production year, and trims title whitespace.

3. **NULL Logic**:
   - The query checks for movies with no actors, providing a clear label that distinguishes them.

4. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - Orders by production year, actor count (descending), and title, showcasing a comprehensive sorting mechanism.

5. **Bizarre Logic**: 
   - Incorporates corner cases such as aggregating keywords and null handling in a plural context while using `COALESCE` for default values.

6. **Unusual SQL Constructs**:
   - Uses window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to rank movies within their production years, along with `STRING_AGG` for keyword aggregation.

This complex query provides a rich dataset for performance benchmarking against various SQL capabilities.
