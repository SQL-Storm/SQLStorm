This SQL query performs a comprehensive analysis of movie actors' contributions, examining the number of movies they are linked to through recursive movie relationships, while simultaneously aggregating additional information about their co-actors, production companies, and keyword associations. It uses various SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and conditional aggregation to provide insightful metrics about actors and their filmographies within a specified timeframe.
