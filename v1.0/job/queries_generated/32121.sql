This query performs the following:

1. Constructs a recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`) to build a hierarchy of movies linked to each other, starting from movies produced in or after 2000.
2. Joins various tables to aggregate information about actors, counting the number of distinct movies they participated in and calculating the average production year.
3. Collects unique keywords associated with the movies while filtering out NULLs using `STRING_AGG`.
4. Retrieves the latest note from the related companies involved in the movie productions using a LEFT JOIN.
5. Filters the results to include only actors with more than five movies and orders the results based on the total number of movies, limiting the output to the top ten results.
