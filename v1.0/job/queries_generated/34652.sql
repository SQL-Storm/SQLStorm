This SQL query constructs a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to build a movie hierarchy, counts the total cast and keywords, aggregates cast names, and calculates the average rating for movies produced from the year 2000 onwards. The use of outer joins, aggregates, and case logic, along with the recursive part, makes this query suitable for performance benchmarking in a complex scenario.
