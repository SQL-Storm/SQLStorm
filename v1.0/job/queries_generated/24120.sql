This SQL query involves Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to generate rankings for movies, calculate cast details, and compile movie information, while applying complex predicates and leveraging outer joins to ensure comprehensive results. The use of string aggregation (`STRING_AGG`) and conditional null handling techniques further demonstrates the intricacies of the data examinations. The second part of the query evaluates the associations between titles and companies while filtering based on criteria that account for production year and title kind.
