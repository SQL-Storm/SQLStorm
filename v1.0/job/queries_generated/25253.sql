This query provides a ranked list of movies produced after the year 2000, detailing the title, production year, number of cast members, genres, and additional information (if available) such as a synopsis. It takes advantage of multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to structure the data gathering and processing for better readability and performance, particularly in string processing and aggregate operations.
