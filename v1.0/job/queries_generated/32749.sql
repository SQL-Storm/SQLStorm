This query leverages the following constructs:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The `ActorHierarchy` CTE builds a recursive hierarchy of actors based on their roles in movies from diffferent production years. The `MovieInfo` CTE aggregates relevant movie details & actor information.

2. **Outer Joins**: The main query uses a LEFT JOIN to continue retrieving movie details even if they have no corresponding cast.

3. **Correlated Subqueries**: Used within the CTE to establish the hierarchy of actors.

4. **Window Functions**: Implicitly uses `COUNT` and `MAX` for aggregation over grouped movie data rather than strict windowing, but modifies standard aggregate functions to provide levels of aggregation.

5. **String Expressions**: `STRING_AGG` releases a concatenated string of actor names for each movie.

6. **NULL Logic**: Includes `COALESCE` to handle NULLs gracefully for both actor count and max level in the final output.

7. **Complicated Predicates/Expressions**: Filters actors based on their roles in movies across defined year ranges and movie types. 

8. **SET operators**: Not explicitly used in this query, but suitable to consider when mixing results from multiple queries.

This elaborate query captures relationships and aggregations pertinent to the film database while providing a performance benchmark vis-Ã -vis the data structure in place.
