### Explanation of the Query Components:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **RankedMovies**: This CTE counts the number of distinct casts per movie and ranks movies based on how many actors they feature within their production year.
   - **TopMovies**: Filters the ranked movies to get only the top 5 films per year based on cast count.
   - **MovieDetails**: Gathers details regarding the title, production year, company name, and an assessment of whether the movie is released or upcoming.

2. **Joins**: 
   - Uses `LEFT JOIN` to connect various tables: `aka_title`, `cast_info`, `movie_companies`, `company_name`, and `movie_info`, ensuring that incomplete data in any one of the tables does not exclude the movie from the results.

3. **String Aggregation**:
   - `STRING_AGG(DISTINCT k.keyword, ', ')` is applied to create a comma-separated list of keywords associated with each movie while avoiding duplicates.

4. **HAVING Clause**: 
   - This filters the aggregated results to include only those movies that are associated with more than one keyword.

5. **Complicated Expressions**:
   - The CASE statement is employed to handle logic distinguishing between movies that have been released vs. those that are upcoming based on the production year comparison.

6. **NULL Logic**: 
   - `COALESCE` function is used to provide a default name for companies when thereâ€™s no data (i.e., if the company name associated with the movie is NULL).

This elaborate query takes into account edge cases and aims to provide a well-rounded overview of the most noteworthy recent movies along with their associated metadata.
