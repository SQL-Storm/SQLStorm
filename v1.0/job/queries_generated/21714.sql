### Explanation
1. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Three are created:
   - `MovieHierarchy` to build a recursive structure of movies and their episodes.
   - `TopCreators` to fetch actors with more than five movies since 2000, along with the titles of those movies.
   - `ActorAwards` which retrieves awards associated with each actor.

2. **Outer Joins**: 
   - Left joins are used to ensure all entries from `FilteredMovies` are retained, even if there are no matching entries in `TopCreators` or `ActorAwards`.

3. **Complicated Logic**: 
   - The `CASE` statement classifies movies into "Spin-off" or "Original".
   - Use of `COALESCE` to replace potential NULL values with default strings.

4. **String Functions**: 
   - `STRING_AGG` to aggregate movie titles into a single field.
   - `STRING_TO_ARRAY` is used to convert a list of titles into an array for comparison.

5. **Window Functions (implied but not overtly shown)**: If you'd like to add any ranking functions or window calculations based on the number of movies or years, it could be incorporated.

6. **Conceptual Complexity**: Links leading back to names and awards provide a link between separate pieces, illustrating the relationships in a rich dataset.

This SQL query purposely leverages various SQL semantics, showcasing many complex elements to provide insights into movie hierarchies, top creators, and awards.
