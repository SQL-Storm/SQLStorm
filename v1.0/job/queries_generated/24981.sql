### Explanation:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: `ranked_movies` and `movie_scores` are used to encapsulate the logic for calculating rankings and scores for movies based on their actor count and info length.
- **Aggregations**: COUNT and AVG are used to calculate the number of actors and average length of the associated movie info, respectively.
- **Window Functions**: The `ROW_NUMBER` function partitions the data by year and ranks movies according to the number of distinct actors.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: We indirectly correlate movie attendance through the actor counts and info, allowing for a meaningful display of metrics.
- **Complex Predicates**: The HAVING clause uses an OR condition to filter results based on keyword count or actor count thresholds.
- **OUTER JOINs**: LEFT JOINs are used to ensure that all titles from the main dataset are represented even if there are no corresponding rows in other tables.
- **String Expressions & NULL Logic**: COALESCE is used to replace NULL values in average_info_length with 0, providing clearer insights.
- **Bizarre SQL semantics**: The use of ambiguous thresholds (like the chosen counts for crowd statuses) highlight obscure and less common analytic models. 

This query is crafted for a performance benchmarking perspective, revealing insights into movie data while demonstrating SQL capabilities.
