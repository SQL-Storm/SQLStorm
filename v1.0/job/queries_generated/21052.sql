This SQL query uses various constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), ranking functions, outer joins, string aggregation, and filtering conditions to create an elaborate performance benchmark scenario. It ranks movies based on the number of roles, counts actors appearing in multiple movies, and aggregates relevant keywords while incorporating NULL logic and multiple predicates to showcase complex SQL semantics.
