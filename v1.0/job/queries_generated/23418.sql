This SQL query leverages multiple advanced constructs including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and outer joins. It stitches together data related to actors, their films, and associated keywords, showcasing performance benchmarks with restricting criteria. It handles NULL cases gracefully and aggregates strings while also involving recursiveness and ranking for titles. The final output will focus on actors and their top titles, with a special emphasis on structured keyword reporting.
