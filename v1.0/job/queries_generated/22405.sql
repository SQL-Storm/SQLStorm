This SQL query encompasses the following elements:

1. **CTEs**: The query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to build a hierarchy of movies based on links, aggregate movie attributes, and count distinct roles.
2. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE recursively finds all related movies based on linked relationships.
3. **Aggregated Data**: The `AggregatedMovies` CTE combines information from the hierarchy, calculating the number of links and average levels of the movie hierarchy.
4. **Role Count**: The `RoleCount` CTE counts unique roles for each movie, highlighting the variety of cast involvement.
5. **NULL Logic**: Uses `COALESCE` to ensure that zeros appear for movies without roles.
6. **Complicated CASE Expressions**: A CASE statement categorizes movies based on the number of links into three descriptive categories.
7. **Complex JOINs**: Incorporates LEFT JOINs to ensure all movies are included regardless of linkage or roles.
8. **Ordering**: Orders results distinctly to highlight linkage categories and other metrics, making the output more informative.

This elaborate query benchmarks movie relationships, casts, and links in a structured and detailed manner.
