### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - The first CTE, `movie_data`, collects relevant movie and casting information, filtering for movies produced from 2000 onwards and ensuring at least one keyword or cast note exists.
   - The second CTE, `aggregate_cast`, aggregates the results from `movie_data`, combining cast notes, company names, keywords, and calculating the total number of distinct cast members.

2. **NULL Logic**:
   - `COALESCE` is used to provide default messages for null values in the result set, ensuring user-friendly output.

3. **Window Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` is employed to create an ordered list of cast members which assists in the aggregation process.

4. **Complicated Predicate**:
   - A filter on the availing of keywords or cast notes uses logical OR.

5. **Subqueries**:
   - A correlated subquery determines whether each movie has a higher cast count than the average.

6. **Set Operators**:
   - There are no explicit set operators used, but aggregations and string concatenations effectively mimic the behavior of a set operation in handling multiple related data entries.

7. **String Expressions**:
   - String aggregations (`STRING_AGG`) are used to compile lists of notes, companies, and keywords into readable formats.

8. **Bizarre Semantics**:
   - The classification of movies based on the number of cast members into 'Large Cast', 'Small Cast', and 'No Cast' introduces a semantical layer that could be considered unusual based on typical reporting practices. 

This query aims to present a detailed yet nuanced view of the cinematic offerings in the specified timeframe, with emphasis on deeper relationships between movies, their associated cast, companies, and keywords.
