### Explanation of Complex Constructs Used:

- **Common Table Expression (CTE):** A recursive CTE (`MovieHierarchy`) that allows for traversing linked movies (either sequels or related).
  
- **LEFT JOINs:** To gather comprehensive movie data including companies involved, cast, and keywords.

- **Aggregations:**
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`: To count unique actors and keywords.
  - `SUM(CASE ...)`: To count award-related information, assuming some info types are tied to awards.

- **Window Functions:** `ROW_NUMBER()` used for ranking movies based on the total number of actors within their respective production years.

- **Complicated Predicates/Expressions:** Filters for production years and non-null company codes.

- **HAVING Clause:** Ensures that only movies with more than 10 unique actors are selected.

- **Ordering:** Final results are ordered by production year and total actors, ensuring the focus on more recent and more popular movies.
