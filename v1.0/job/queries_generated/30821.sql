This SQL query does the following:

1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: `movie_hierarchy` retrieves movies produced from the year 2000 onward and explores linked movies recursively to build a hierarchy of films. 

2. **Main Query**: It aggregates data related to each movie in the hierarchy.

3. **Joins**: It includes several LEFT JOINs to gather data from `movie_companies`, `movie_info`, `complete_cast`, `cast_info`, and `aka_name`.

4. **Aggregations**: It counts the number of companies associated with each movie, averages the length of associated movie info, counts unique cast members, and concatenates the names of cast members.

5. **Filtering and Grouping**: The results are filtered to show only movies that are associated with at least one company, and the results are ordered by production year, unique cast member count, and movie title. 

This query tests the performance with various SQL constructs like CTEs, joins, aggregations, and string functions, making it useful for benchmarking.
