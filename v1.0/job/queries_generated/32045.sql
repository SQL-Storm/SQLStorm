### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - **ActorHierarchy**: Generates a hierarchy of actors based on their roles in movies, traversing the `cast_info` table.
   - **MovieKeywords**: Aggregates keywords associated with each movie using string aggregation.
   - **MovieGenres**: Derives movie genres from the `aka_title` and `kind_type` tables.
   - **MovieCompanies**: Counts the distinct companies associated with each movie and collects their names.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and `title` tables to gather actor names, movie details, and their associations.
   - Uses left joins to incorporate aggregated keywords, genres, and company details.
   - Utilizes window functions to rank movies for each actor based on production year.
   - Applies filtering criteria to focus on movies produced between 2000 and 2023 while ensuring at least one genre or keyword is present.
   - Excludes movies that have a complete cast record.

This query provides a comprehensive view linking actors to their roles, enriched with keywords, genres, and associated companies, while also addressing performance considerations through proper indexing and utilizing CTEs for optimization.
