This SQL query:

1. Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to construct a recursive hierarchy for movies linked to each other.
2. Joins the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, and the recursive movie hierarchy.
3. Counts distinct movies for each actor, computes the maximum production year of linked movies, and averages the link depth.
4. Extracts distinct keywords associated with the movies.
5. Incorporates conditional logic to provide actor status based on the number of movies acted in.
6. Filters results based on having more than one distinct movie or at least one linked movie.
7. Orders results by the most recent movie year and limits the output to 10 results. 

The query leverages various SQL constructs including outer joins, window functions, group aggregates, string aggregators, and NULL logic, perfect for performance benchmarking.
