This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: It uses two CTEs (`RankedMovies` and `MovieRatings`) to first rank the movies based on their casting order and then count the keywords associated with each movie.

2. **Filters**: The first CTE filters movies from the year 2000 onwards, ensuring the keyword is not NULL.

3. **Window Functions**: It employs window functions, such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, to rank the cast members and `COUNT(*) OVER` to count the keywords per movie.

4. **Final Selection**: The final SELECT statement retrieves movies that have more than one associated keyword, providing a list ordered by production year and movie title. 

This complex query showcases string processing by leveraging multiple joins, CTEs, and window functions to analyze and retrieve rich data about movies, their keywords, and the roles of cast members.
