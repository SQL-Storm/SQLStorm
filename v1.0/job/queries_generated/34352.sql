This SQL query utilizes various constructs:
- **Recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)**: To build a hierarchy of movies based on their links to other movies.
- **Outer Joins**: To include movies that might not have any associated cast information while still counting them in the results.
- **Aggregations**: Using `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `STRING_AGG` to summarize data.
- **Window Functions**: To rank results based on the production year and hierarchy level.
- **Subquery**: To find the appropriate `info_type_id` for filtering on specific movie info.
- **Complicated predicates**: Filtering non-null movie production years and having a minimum cast count.
- **String expressions**: To create a path showing the relationship of linked movies.
