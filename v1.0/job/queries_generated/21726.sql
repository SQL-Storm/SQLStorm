This query utilizes various SQL constructs like CTEs, window functions, outer joins, and complex predicates, showcasing some intricate semantics in SQL. It benchmarks movies by their production year, counts actors, and categorizes themâ€”all while testing the boundaries of null logic and including unusual conditions.
