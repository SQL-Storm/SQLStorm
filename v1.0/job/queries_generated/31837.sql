This query utilizes multiple complex constructs:

1. **Recursive CTE (`movie_hierarchy`)**: This retrieves a hierarchy of movies including individual episodes if present.
2. **Common Table Expression (CTE) for cast details (`cast_details`)**: It fetches cast information along with their respective ordering in the cast list using `ROW_NUMBER()`.
3. **Keyword aggregation (`movie_keywords`)**: A separate CTE aggregates keywords associated with each movie using `STRING_AGG()`.
4. **Outer joins**: `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that all movies are returned, even if they donâ€™t have associated cast or keywords.
5. **Conditional logic**: A `CASE` statement determines the presence of keywords and labels them accordingly.
6. **Window functions**: `COUNT(DISTINCT ci.person_id) OVER(PARTITION BY mh.movie_id)` counts the total distinct cast members for each movie while maintaining the main query's row structure. 

This combination provides a comprehensive view of movie relationships, cast roles, and associated keywords.
