This SQL query demonstrates various advanced SQL features:

1. **Recursive CTE**: The `MovieHierarchy` CTE builds a hierarchy of movies starting from those produced in 2000 and retrieves their linked movies recursively.
2. **Window Functions**: 
   - `COUNT` with `OVER(PARTITION BY...)` calculates the total number of movies for each actor.
   - `ROW_NUMBER` assigns a rank based on the production year to each movie for each actor.
3. **Outer Join**: A left join on `movie_keyword` and `keyword` to retrieve keywords related to each movie while still including movies without keywords.
4. **Aggregations**: `STRING_AGG` is used to concatenate all distinct keywords for each movie into a single string.
5. **Handling NULL values**: The `COALESCE` function provides a default display for movies without a specified production year.
6. **Complicated predicates**: The WHERE clause includes a filter for non-null actor names and production years. 

This query is structured to provide an interesting and comprehensive view of actors' contributions to movies, including details about production years and associated keywords.
