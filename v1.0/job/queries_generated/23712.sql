This SQL query incorporates various constructs and techniques, including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive movie hierarchy generation.
- LEFT JOINs to retrieve information from multiple tables, accounting for potential nulls.
- COALESCE for handling null values.
- CASE statements for conditional logic.
- Window functions to count unique cast members grouped by movie.
- FILTER and STRING_AGG to aggregate keywords while ignoring null values.
- Common predicates and complicated filtering criteria within the WHERE clause.
- An elaborate HAVING clause to impose restrictions based on aggregation. 

All of this is designed to extract insightful, structured data while remaining compliant with the complexities of SQL semantics.
