### Explanation of SQL Query Components:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Two CTEs are used, the first (`MovieDetails`) gathers aggregated data on movies including cast counts and awards, while the second (`RankedMovies`) ranks them within their production years based on cast count.

2. **LEFT JOINs**: Several left joins ensure the query does not exclude movies with no related records in the keyword, complete_cast, and movie_info tables.

3. **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT()` and `SUM()` are utilized to calculate total cast members and awards, respectively, effectively handling NULL values with `COALESCE()`.

4. **Window Functions**: `RANK()` is applied to assign ranks to movies based on cast count partitioned by production year.

5. **CASE Expressions**: Used to derive custom status labels depending on the presence or absence of cast and awards.

6. **Complex Predicate Logic**: The `WHERE` clause includes a range check on `production_year` while accommodating NULL values.

7. **Ordering**: Finally, the results are ordered by production year and descending cast count.

This query is elaborate, showcasing various SQL constructs and demonstrating the handling of corner cases like NULL logicâ€”while also aiming for an interesting analysis of the benchmarked movie data.
