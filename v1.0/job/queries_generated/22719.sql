This intricate SQL query uses a recursive common table expression (CTE) to traverse a hierarchy of movies linked together (up to a depth of 5), while performing multiple complex joins and aggregations on the `aka_name`, `cast_info`, `aka_title`, `movie_info`, `movie_companies`, `company_name`, `company_type`, and `person_info` tables. The query also utilizes window functions to rank movies by their production year for each actor. Additionally, it handles potential NULL values and enforces various predicates to filter results, showcasing the power and versatility of SQL in handling elaborate queries.
