This SQL query performs the following operations:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `RankedTitles` CTE ranks films from the `aka_title` table based on their production year and associates them with keywords.

2. **Joins**: It then joins several tables:
   - `cast_info` to link titles to actors.
   - `aka_name` to fetch the actor names.
   - The `RankedTitles` CTE to get movie details.
   - `movie_info` to filter movies that have a budget.
   - `movie_keyword` and `keyword` to pull associated keywords.

3. **Filters**: The query filters for movies produced from the year 2000 onwards, ensuring that the movie has budget information. 

4. **Aggregation**: It counts distinct keywords associated with each movie and distinguishes the number of roles the actor has.

5. **Group and Order**: Finally, it groups the results by actor name, movie title, and production year and orders them by production year in descending order, then by actor name, providing a clear view of the data.

This would provide a rich dataset for benchmarking string processing, particularly with names and titles alongside relevant keywords.
